Luckily enough, you father is Chieftain Magrash, which entitles you to sleep in the Chieftain's Hut, the largest hut. As you enter, you see your father sitting in a rough woolen tunic, sharpening his greatsword. In front of him is his heavy steel plate armor, as well as several trophies from his battles.\n\n\n\"Mazkil, Gruzub, you fight too much. Mama is trying to put Dagden to sleep.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, papa.\" You both reply.\n\n\n\"Who won the fight?\" He asks.\n\n\n\"I did!\" You both say, before glaring at each other.\n\n\n\"You don't know? Perhaps you're not fighting enough. Gruzub, go down to the river and fetch water for the stew. Mazkil, sharpen my sword. I need light the hearth.\"\n\n\nYou go over to the sword, and begin to sharpen it against the whet stone, while looking over your father's trophies: An Elven Dagger, a Shrunken head, a battered golden shield, a shattered battleaxe, a studded mace, a series of Tribal Necklaces and a Dragon Skull.\n\n\n\"Papa?\"\n\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\n\"Can you tell me about your trophies?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"I've told you many times about my trophies.\"\n\n\n\"Tell me again.\"\n\n\nPapa chuckles, a harsh sound you've come to love.\n\n\n\"Which would you like to know about?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Elven Dagger (Elves)", "result": "\"Ah, the dagger.

Still, they're fast with a blade and good with a bow, which I found out while hunting a party of them that came into my territory.
