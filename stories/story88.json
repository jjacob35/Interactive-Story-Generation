The refuge of all who refuse to move out of the house for whatever reason.\n\nSome of them are dreamers who just can\u2019t fit into proper society.\n\nSome of them have potential, but due to personality quirks fame has escaped them.\n\nAnd finally 99% of them are just downright pathetic losers that just fail at life.\n\nSo choose one of these basement dwellers and enjoy the desperation and horror of their tales!

The dream world will have to wait until later.\n\nYou don\u2019t like real world, never have. It\u2019s why you like to sleep. It allows you to get away from the reality for a little while. It\u2019s also why you prefer to hang out on your computer all night and day.\n\nIt\u2019s not really because you\u2019re afraid of the real world, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t have that much interest in it. Sometimes it can be fascinating, but over all you just find it to be involve so much boring tedium that you\u2019d prefer to remove yourself as much as you can from it.\n\nIt\u2019s also probably why you\u2019re over 18 and still living at home.\n\nYou\u2019re a basement dweller.\n\nFortunately you\u2019re one of the productive ones. You contribute to the household by buying and selling useless shit on Ebay. Unfortunately this is still \u201cwork\u201d and as a result, it\u2019s a hassle so you probably don\u2019t put as much effort as you should into it. In fact you\u2019re more inclined to keep the stuff you buy due to your interest in odd things.\n\nDespite your limiting of outside world contact, you can\u2019t help but feel like something different is going to happen today. You start daydreaming about possible things that could happen to you until you quickly snap yourself out of it.\n\nAs much as you\u2019d like to waste time daydreaming, playing video games or other time wasting activities on the internet, you probably should go to \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nWell don\u2019t just sit there with a thumb up your ass, you gonna buy useless shit, or sell it?", "action_results": [{"action": "Buy useless shit", "result": "You decide to buy more useless shit.

True you rarely go out anymore, but maybe this would be the thing that could do it!\n\nYou see a bomb shelter for sale made of xentronium armor. Could be useful in these dangerous times we live in and it\u2019ll definitely provide you more protection than the basement.\n\nThere\u2019s a small island made of Styrofoam in the middle of the ocean. It says it\u2019s held together by hemp. While you\u2019ve never been one for the beaches and sun, you wonder if you could rent it out some how. Maybe movie producers would pay you to use it or something.\n\nActually perhaps something more practical might be good, there\u2019s some toilet paper for sale. You know you always need that!\n\nFinally, you see a building for sale; it doesn\u2019t really give a description.
