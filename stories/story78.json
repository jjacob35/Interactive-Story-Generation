We left underspace half an hour ago,\u201d Hinsman says from beside you. \u201cSmooth as butter. They have stabilizers set up here now, I didn\u2019t know that. This system\u2019s really had some work put into it since I was here last.\u201d\n\nIn his fifties but not yet looking his age, he\u2019s supposed to be dressed as an asteroid speculator out on holiday and is struggling in the narrow confines of his seat to tug his coat on. Hinsman\u2019s on the short side, and the garment is a couple of sizes too big. All around you others, tourists, businessmen, and families, are starting to collect their things as well.\n\n\u201cAnyway, just waiting on our transfer now.\u201d\n\nYou unsnap your safety belt. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHinsman\u2019s got the aisle seat, just one more factor in his unspoken role in keeping you from too much direct contact with the public. Fine by you. Your job has always been to protect these people, not make conversation. Gazing out the window, you have a good view of the green planet. Camarov IV. It\u2019s supposed to be beautiful, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re here to sightsee. This is just your fastest route back to work.\n\nThe Order cruiser you\u2019d been using got enough of a beating on your last mission it needed to be taken to a real shipyard for repairs, and meanwhile this transport was headed directly for Camarov and had two vacancies. There\u2019s another Order ship en route to here which you\u2019ll transfer to to be taken back to the Outer Rim. You\u2019ll never even set foot on this planet.\n\nThere is a gentle thud as the landing ship locks on and the crew starts shepherding passengers towards the exit. Hinsman combs his dark hair and tends to the mustache he\u2019s been cultivating. You just sit and wait.\n\nBoth of your wrist comms beep at the same time, and you see the Order ship has left underspace. There\u2019s a little flurry among the crew when it requests to lock on, but Hinsman flashes a badge and his signature smile and the two of you transfer over without incident.\n\nOnce aboard, the ship unlocks and moves to a safe distance for a jump. Then there\u2019s a delay as the pilot seems to have no intention of leaving until he downloads whatever media Camarov IV has to offer. Images of green hills and misty lakes and crystal spires and dancers on a stage and some sort of historical reimagining of Old Earth tumble across the viewscreen.\n\nThe pilot, Karoff, is middle aged, tall and with thinning blond hair just starting to shade to grey. His mustache however is much more impressive than Hinsman\u2019s. You\u2019ve worked with him before. You don't always get his sense of humor, but he's okay.\n\nThe next stop will be The Last Outpost for refueling, then you'll be taken along a scenic tour alternating between the most boring and dangerous parts of the Outer Rim as you go down the list fulfilling your various obligations there and being available to lend assistance in emergencies.\n\nYou lean against the wall and mentally check out until it\u2019s time to strap in for the jump to underspace. Hinsman was right, the in system stabilizers do improve the experience quite a bit.\n\n\n*****\n\n\nThe Last Outpost is dark when you approach.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Karoff mutters. The station floats in place like a fat black spider against the pale backdrop of the system\u2019s single barren planetoid. Karoff makes a few adjustments to make your approach less obvious and then starts running scans from a distance. It took you nearly a week to get out this far from Camarov and you\u2019re all aware that if there\u2019s trouble it\u2019ll be just as long before you can find any backup.\n\nThe Last Outpost was once a research hospital on the edge of protected space. Now it\u2019s a ways past the official line, although after the rollback it persisted as a stopover and fueling station for both the military and any junker the colony worlds could put together to evacuate in. Officially out of service and abandoned now as far as anyone outside the Order is supposed to know, it\u2019s still got enough automated defenses that any scavengers looking for scrap will be sent packing in a hurry. Or it used to, anyway. Hinsman is frowning over the console now too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cPirates?\u201d\n\nHinsman shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. The way some of the plating is buckled, this looks like a string of explosions from the inside. Mostly just in that one arm, but the defenses are offline and there\u2019s no more than basic life support anywhere on the station.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a soft beep as a scan is completed.\n\n\u201cOne life sign,\u201d Karoff grunts.\n\n\u201cEven if they pulled out everyone on mission, there should\u2019ve be at least three here for maintenance still.\u201d Hinsman joins you at the window as he finishes speaking and stares across the distance. \u201cBut...I\u2019ll hail them I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well. Doesn\u2019t look like they have much left to shoot at us anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope appearances aren\u2019t deceiving.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Inquiry", "result": "Karoff looks tense as Hinsman tries to contact the station. There\u2019s a long wait with no reply. He frowns and tries once again using Order passcodes.\n\nA green light blinks on, and then a moment later a haggard-looking blonde woman with high cheekbones and thin lips appears on the viewscreen with a crackling of static. \u201cSo someone finally did show up.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s voice is flat and blank. She\u2019s young and might have been pretty under other circumstances, but her eyes have dark rings under them, her face is sallow and her hair hasn\u2019t seen a brush in awhile. She dips a spoon in a tub of drippy, melting ice cream while staring at the screen indifferently.\n\nKaroff pulls up her ID while Hinsman coughs and clears his throat. \u201cAh...you\u2019re Matti Oswen, correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Agent Hinsman. We were just stopping over on our way into the Rim, but it looks like you\u2019ve had a bit of trouble here. Do you need assistance?\u201d He keeps his tone light and injects a note of friendly concern.\n\nShe blinks at him owlishly a moment, then sets the ice cream aside and scratches lightly at the side of her neck. \u201cI sent out a call, but the computer lost power and I\u2019m not sure it went through. That was...almost a week ago, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a maintenance worker, correct? What happened here, Matti? And where are the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cInea and Markov? Oh, they\u2019re dead.\u201d Her voice is still flat and strangely disinterested.\n\nKaroff dutifully pulls up their IDs as well. Their new status as deceased hasn\u2019t been updated in the Order database yet, anyhow, and as the three of you have heard nothing regarding the damage to the station or a rescue attempt you can only assume her distress signal never did make it out.\n\nOswen continues only after Hinsman prompts her again. \u201cInea had an accident while doing repairs and Markov killed himself and tried to take the rest of the station with him a couple of days later. I rerouted the power to redirect the blast just in time, but most of the generators still blew. I\u2019ve been sitting around in the dark and trying to eat everything in the freezers before it all spoils, and then figuring I\u2019d inject myself with something before the oxygen fails.\u201d\n\nHinsmans voice is soothing. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that Matti, but you\u2019ll be safe now. We\u2019re going to send out a request for help and then lock on to see what we can do about repairs in the meantime. We can route enough power over to make sure life support holds up, anyway.\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nOnce the call is cut, a distress signal is sent back to headquarters along with a short recorded message. The three of you briefly go over the situation.\n\nHinsman sums it all up. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a few days before anyone can arrive to help, and we can\u2019t leave until then. Even if no survivors were here, the station itself is vulnerable and hell, it\u2019s probably more necessary to the Order than any of us, if we\u2019re being honest. Although this Oswen woman...she might be in shock, or there might be something else going on there. Not sure we can trust her.\u201d\n\nKaroff spits out the end of his mustache. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get in there and find out the bitch slit their throats and made bikini tops out of their skin. Seen it happen before.\u201d\n\nYou look at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh, well not the skinning for bikinis part, but people get assigned to an out of the way place like this too long, they can just snap and start killing each other. Or there maybe was some kind of love triangle going on that turned nasty. And not the good kind of nasty,\u201d he adds, apparently feeling the need to clarify.\n\n\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re just going to have to risk our skins then,\u201d Hinsman says with a slight roll of his eyes. \u201cOr you and I anyway, Karoff. But Zee, you were always going to be working alone anyhow. You won\u2019t have us standing by in orbit if you go on by yourself, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from suiting up and taking a spare shuttle, if the job is urgent enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill may be awhile before we know exactly how bad the damage is to the Outpost,\u201d Karoff points out. \u201cShe could be needed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but...Zee, I guess this one is going to be your call. I don\u2019t have details on the mission you\u2019ve been requested for, so what\u2019s protocol here?\u201d\n\nThis would all be simpler if you could directly contact a commander, of course, but out here that\u2019s rarely possible and having to make decisions like this on the fly is part of the job.\n\nORDER when it started out stood for Outer Rim Defense, Evaluation and Research. The joke everyone likes to make is how when the Hunger virus appeared on the scene the E stood for Evacuation, and then finally Eradication.\n\nOf course that\u2019s the part you\u2019re all still working on. And it\u2019s not actually all that funny.\n\nThe Order is the peacekeeping force out past the edge of protected space, although not in any kind of official capacity anymore. A little over twenty years ago when the Hunger virus was at its peak and blazing from planet to planet, the border was rolled back and then rolled back again. Colonies and mining facilities, trading stations and outposts were cut off in the midst of the chaos and anyone who wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t evacuate was left to fend for themselves.\n\nSome of the Order agents were recalled back to New Terra, but for many more this was their home, this was just what they did. Momentum and habit went a long way and the organization already had enough ships, stations and equipment out here to continue operating much as they always had. If anything they were more effective now that the bureaucracy and red tape had been stripped away, although that sometimes birthed its own kind of controversy.\n\nIndependent, isolated colonies and small time miners and traders had no one to protect them from piracy, not to mention the trade consortiums that amounted to a more organized version of the same thing. They welcomed the Order\u2019s presence on one hand while resenting anything they perceived as meddling in their own affairs on another. In areas where the line between New Terra and frontier authorities blurred, certain parties also never failed to point out that the Order had no more jurisdiction than any other private organization; outside of the ancient one of might making right and the bit about possession and how it related to law, anyhow.\n\nAnd although on paper the organization kept to the same laws and standards they had from the beginning, they were just as on their own out here as anyone and had to see to their own people\u2019s interests and protection as well. New blood could be hard enough to find as it was without asking it to spill itself simply because it was the right thing to do. About the only thing anyone could agree on was that the Order were the only ones equipped to really do anything about the Hunger virus and so they should be left to it, no questions asked.\n\nSo thankfully, politics and the rest of that nonsense aren\u2019t anything you ever have to concern yourself with. All you do is your job, and all you worry about is doing it well. Right now that means making a judgment call on where you\u2019ll be the most effective. And right now, that does seem to be here. Nothing you were given indicated anyone was in direct danger, and the Last Outpost is as valuable to the Order as any of the other facilities you were asked to check on, and far more strategically important. The refueling station is what makes these little forays out in this area of Rim possible in the first place.", "action_results": [{"action": "Secure the station.", "result": "You indicate to the others that you\u2019ll stay for now and Karoff directs the ship on a route toward the station. It makes sense to at least do a cursory inspection of the damage and make sure that at least life support will hold up. And of course there\u2019s the other issue of the alleged sabotage and personnel having been lost under circumstances still waiting to be confirmed. Leaving just two operatives to handle it all isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nOf the station\u2019s eight arms, the docking bay is luckily on the side that\u2019s suffered the least damage. Karoff locks on without incident and the panels of the reinforced portal retract with a gentle whirring. Beyond, the station is dark and cold. You all file out and make your way out of the landing bay and down a hallway with the aid of flashlights. With what little power remains rerouted to life support, the portal to the central complex refuse to open. Attempts to contact Oswen on a short range channel fail, and so Hinsman finally gets the door moving with the aid of his gun; wiring the energy cell to the panel next to it, that is. At the jolt of power it snaps open with sudden speed, then begins to close again in slow motion and grinds to a halt about a third of the way. The three of you squeeze past and before long find yourselves in an open area, a kind of joint dining hall and exercise room with dead video screens lining the walls.\n\nThe kitchen area behind the dining hall is a disaster zone of empty plastic trays, overflowing trash bins and spoiled food. There\u2019s no sign of Matti although you do find her abandoned ice cream bucket. The three of you begin to search area by area. Although reluctant to split up, you do move a bit faster than the others and take to checking into rooms and around corners ahead of them.\n\nA pool of vivid crimson against the polished grey tile is your first confirmation that something has gone wrong. You race forward to Matti Oswen\u2019s crumpled form and check her pulse, clamping another hand down on the stub of her severed arm. Lifting the woman from the ground and calling out to the others, you splash your way through the blood, tracking it behind you while more soaks into your uniform.\n\nA medical station was one of the places the three of you had already searched, so you hasten to it and deposit her on a steel table, keeping your grip just above the wound while Hinsman activates the computer.\n\n\u201cThis nursing AI was obsolete fifteen years ago,\u201d he grumbles, taking a protective suit from a persistently dinging open door and yanking it on over his clothes.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit of overkill?\u201d Karoff asks, watching him.\n\nHinsman\u2019s response is muffled through the breathing filter. \u201cIt won\u2019t let me even proceed without it. This place was last used to quarantine evacuees exposed to Hunger, there\u2019s no such thing as overkill as far as the computer is concerned. Just be glad the whole station isn\u2019t set to self destruct the moment someone gets a paper cut.\u201d He pauses a moment to apply a tourniquet. \u201cNow...Zee, you step back, it hates you too.\u201d\n\nKaroff looks at you and snorts. \u201cI imagine so. You look like you just left the scene of an axe murder.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d already moved away at Hinsman\u2019s order, and now you ruefully wipe you face, hoping to achieve a clean spot. Karoff\u2019s ensuing guffaw informs you you probably just made the situation worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go clean up the mess in the hall...and myself,\u201d you say, turning to go.\n\n\u201cZee, wait, wait, Miss Oswen is going to need an arm transplant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nYou blink at Karoff. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\nThis just provokes more laughter.\n\nHinsman, who has been preoccupied with the soothing voice of the medical AI and the use of instruments taken out of little drawers that have been popping open in sequence, now shakes his head at the two of you as he changes to clean gloves. \u201cI\u2019m not that good a doctor, I\u2019m afraid. Zee, you go on.\u201d\n\nHe snaps his fingers at Karoff and in the other hand produces an oversized needle, like a magician\u2019s trick. \u201cBut I will need a blood donor, and guess who\u2019s compatible?\u201d\n\nAlready on your way out, you turn and get a glimpse of the pilot\u2019s grimace as the door slides shut between you.\n\n\n\nCleaning up is a tedious but straightforward affair. You scrub yourself down and change into a plain grey jumpsuit you find before returning to the scene of the accident and getting to work.", "action_results": [{"action": "Dispose of the severed arm", "result": "It seems Oswen had been trying to unjam a door that leads to one of the station\u2019s storage arms, in much the same way Hinsman had gotten you all into the central complex earlier. It was her misfortune that upon receiving a jolt from a maintenance tool the door had snapped shut, meaning it had been open to begin with.\n\nThere\u2019s enough juice left to get it back to where it was and you carefully retrieve the severed limb on the other side, slipping it into a biohazard bag. Taking a moment to confirm with Hinsman there\u2019s nothing he can do as far as reattaching it, you consider your options for disposal. An incinerator would the most straightforward, but those require an amount of energy that seems wasteful if not impossible to produce given the station\u2019s current reliance on emergency backup power for life support.\n\nYou remember then the walk in freezer in the kitchen behind the dining hall. At least that would keep it from rotting if it takes longer that expected to get the power on full. The room isn\u2019t able to maintain freezing temps anymore but it\u2019s still noticeably colder than the rest of the station, and the rest of the station is cold enough. Placing the bagged arm on a shelf, you halt a moment as your gaze fixes on the two bundled forms in the back.

Further details will have to wait till she\u2019s conscious again, you suppose.\n\nYou zip the bag back up and turn your attention to Inea. The dark haired woman\u2019s cause of death is immediately obvious, her skull on the left side having been caved in just above and behind the ear. \u2018An accident while doing repairs\u2019 was how Matti had described her death. While you can\u2019t yet find anything to contradict that, as you probe along the edges of the splintered bits of skull and cold globs of brain matter it seems to you it would\u2019ve taken an awful lot of force concentrated in that one spot all at once to do that kind of damage.\n\nThen again, Matti had nearly managed to kill herself as well. You wonder what sort of accident it was supposed to have been. It\u2019s almost incredible to you that three people so incompetent had been left in charge of such an important Outpost. It\u2019s true that space is a big place and Order agents and personnel are stretched thin, but in your experience it\u2019s rare for things to go this spectacularly wrong without someone being at fault.\n\nFinding nothing more of note, you close up that body bag too and then exit the freezer.
