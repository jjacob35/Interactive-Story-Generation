A group of dark wizards called The Black Hand rule over the land without mercy. They are the very essence of evil. The Black Hand seized power by murdering the nation's entire council and executing the Grand Master Juno in public before the capital city of Ceilondra, for all the people to see. Only one group are brave enough to attempt to overthrow The Black Hand from their ill gotten leadership. They call themselves the Rising Sun. Although they had wizards, they were still not powerful enough to challenge a high member of The Black Hand. Yet one day, from atop a high mountain, one of the last true seers amplified his voice for the world to hear. That is where your story began.\n\n\n\"A Hero has been born!\" He called, \"One who will Herald Light and prosperity into this land and vanquish the evil Black Hand!\"\n\n\nThe Black Hand had the seer executed and had an \"ambassador\" (just another agent from their thug army) go to every town, village and city to convince the people that the man was crazy.\n\n\nStill, the people believed the seer and The Rising Sun gained momentum enough to recruit more wizards and men. They built a strong hold that was named \"Hero's Rise\".\n\n\nOn the Day of the Prophet, your people's winter solstice, was when your first story truly started...\n\n\n(Time will have very little factor but when I use it, it shall be measured in Days/Months/Years, since the day of the prophet)", "action_results": [{"action": "What world is this?", "result": "            This world is called Malfosia and is full of magic and amazing creatures. The history will come first. In the beginning, there were simple tribes of all races moving from one place to another. Then, elves came from across the sea, pursued by an alliance of evil creatures called The Crimson Wave. They brought fear to the dwarves, humans and other creatures, though they did not mean to. Through the fear, (as it came commonly known) all creatures began developing into groups according to their race. With all developing cultures, friction grew amongst the races. Through skillful manipulation of the elves, a whisper here, a hand here, the races united into a great alliance ruled by the great council. That was when the elves revealed themselves. They said this was all foretold in the books of prophecy and asked to join the The Alliance Of All (as it came to be known).\n\n\n \n\n         Centuries of prosperity and peace followed, except for the occasional tyrant trying to build an empire that failed. Then the wave came. After hundreds of years, they had nearly forgotten why they were building the great armada. As a prophecy said,  \"A young orc with his head full of steam and heart full of hate shall find the ancient text, and they shall sail.\" And sail they did, after the young orc announced his findings and becoming a general. Their attack was swift and brutal. They colonized the northern reaches where no creature ventured lightly. After fifty years of fighting, the alliance broke and the council fell. That was when The Black Hand revealed itself. They pushed the city into submission and forced most of the evils behind The Wall as it came to be known. Now they rule Salria, which was once a mix of all races. The Black Hand named the whole land Salria, but the words of the prophets were scribed on every stone. All waited for the hero to come, waited for you...", "action_results": [{"action": "Back to the story", "result": "Age 10\n\n\n         You had a fairly uneventful life so far, in a small farming community. Then one day, after school, a group of Black Hand families moved to the village and renamed it Blacksend. The Black Hand Kids bullied you in school and the teachers were too afraid of their families to do anything to stop them. They teased you because you worked for you place in the world. Soon they progressed from childish taunts to physical violence. One day when they insulted your mother, you became too angry to control yourself, even though there were five of them and only one of you. You punched one in the face, kicked another in the groin and knocked another out before they had time to react. The others geared up for the fight. One boy called Pollux swung a wild roundhouse punch at your head. Ducking under, you saw a opening. What do you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Punch pollux in the stomach", "result": "\"Oof!\"\n\n\n      While you were punching Pollux, you got elbowed in the back by Teirnus, then beaten to the ground and left as the teacher rang the bell to signify the end of the day. The days that follow are filled with worry and your parents constantly yelling, \"What were you thinking? They're Black Hands!\" and \"They're coming for you! What will we do when they come?\"\n\n\nFour moons later they came for you. With your throat slit and your body beaten, they hang a sign on you which reads, \"He fought against The Black Hands! See what happens?\" Now the Lands will never be free!", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Kick Teirnus in the chest", "result": "Good choice!\n\n\n             Turns out Teirnus was going for a cowardly attack on your back. Once you take Teirnus out, he collapses on the floor, struggling to breath. Looking around you, you realized that Pollux was left as your only opponent left. You circled each other warily before you finally lunged at him with a feint. Pollux bought it and as he went to catch your foot, he got a crushing left hook. Finally, he was on the ground, wailing in agony. Oh no, what have you done? \"This isn't the end Raven! You will regret this!\" Pollux shouted after you.\n\n\nIt was forbidden in Salira to attack a Black Hand! Realizing what you had done, you ran home and packed your bags as quickly as you could. Your father was still working in the fields at the time, but your mom was home baking and heard you rushing inside.\n\n\n\"What's wrong love? Why are you packing all your things?\" She asked.\n\n\n\"I... I knocked out five Black Hand children!\" You admitted to her, cringing with guilt while your mother stared at you in shock.\n\n\n\"What?\" She asked with wide eyes, horrified at your thoughtless actions. \"Don't you realize what you've done? You ruined this family!\"\n\n\n\"I know mother!\" You told her in shame. \"That is why I'm leaving this family forever. I am going to The Rising Sun.\"\n\n\nYour mother was painfully cold towards your departure. \"Fine! Go! But no one knows where they are boy!\"\n\n\nAfter that, you stormed out of the house, only stopping to say goodbye to your father who surprised you by giving you a steel dagger, much better than your old bronze one.\n\n\nEventually, you reached the forest of Thul. You could live of the land easy here and you wouldn't be a danger to your family any more. You took a moment to review your pack. Your trusty bow, clothes, food and money and the dagger your father gave you. There are two paths leading into the forest. Which should you take, the left or the right?", "action_results": [{"action": "Left path", "result": "Age 16\n\n\nLife in the forest has been easy since you left home. You hunted deer and rabbit among other wild game, but mostly you were the one that was hunted. Luckily, because your skills and knowledge of the forest, you easily evaded all the Black Hand patrols. Anything the forest didn't provide, you traded for in the nearby town of Thull. One day in town you were checking the bounties of the land. Yep, you were still there with a reward of 50 gold coins. You overheard two guards watching a member of their order beating a young girl.\n\n\n\"Yeah, you hear? New kid graduated from the city, killin' left, right and center.\" The first guard said.\n\n\n\"What's 'is name? He arrived here yesterday, plannin' on leading a manhunt in the Thul forest for some kid who beat the shit out of him.\" Responded the second.\n\n\n\"What? When? Why?\" You blurted out.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow. An' kid, fuck off before you end up like her.\" The guard told you, gesturing to the kid in the middle of the square, probably 16 like you.\n\n\nYou couldn't control your temper and yelled back to the guard. \"Shove it, shit head!' Shoving him back to his friend.\n\n\n\"You're dead fucker!\" Drawing his sword, his friend followed him with an evil grin.\n\n\nGood thing you brought your dagger and bow. You quickly brought your bow around and drew an arrow. You shot the first guard and the guard who was beating on the girl instantly charged you. The dead guard's buddy was closer, but you were better with your bow than dagger, so you could shoot the drunk guard or stab the one closest to you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot the charging guard", "result": "As you fire an arrow through the eye of the charging guard, the kid who was being beaten groaned out to you, trying to get up and draw a small dagger she was carrying. \"Behind you!\"\n\n\nAs fast as you could, you spun around, swinging your dagger as you turned. Unfortunately, you were too late. With a sword in your chest, you lost all feeling in your hand and dropped your dagger.\n\n\nYou died watching the guard gloat over you.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stab the close guard", "result": "Dropping your bow, you turned around and drew your dagger. You saw the guard wielding his sword over his head, poised to stab your chest. You moved faster than you thought possible and swept your dagger across his chest, stabbing him in the stomach. His bowels emptied onto the street and his most recent meal spilled out from the hole you made. Half-digested chicken and bread spilled into a pile of shit, along with a geyser of beer. Wow, that was disgusting.\n\n\nTurning around from the gruesome site, you once again noticed the other guard. He had a look of surprise on his face, it took you a few seconds to figure out why since your attention was on the sword in his hand. After a moment, you spotted the point of a dagger poking out of where the guard's heart was. The point withdrew and standing behind him was a bruised and battered girl of your age.\n\n\nYou stoo to grab your bow. \n\n\nShe knelt down with you. \"Thank you, my name is Sparrow.\" She spoke as she grabbed the dead solider's sword and sword belt.\n\n\n\"Here I am called Hunter, but my name is Raven.\" You told her, grabbing a sword and moving your dagger to your left side so you could sheath the sword on your right.\n\n\nBoth of you spoke about yourselves as you two grabbed the solider's purses. You heard a faint yell to the east and touching Sparrow's arm, you snuck to a building and checked the road. You saw a face you hoped to never see again.\n\n\nPollux and Teirnus were at the lead of their old gang and a group of soldiers. Both of their faces were red with rage as they were shooting fireballs in the air. You knew enough about magic to know they were extremely angry, just to waste energy intimidating you.\n\n\n\"Time to go Sparrow.\" You told your new friend. \"A group of soldiers with five Black Hands who hate me is not a good combo.\"\n\n\n\"Where to my feathered friend?\" She asked you with a friendly smile.\n\n\n\"My house is not easy to find, plus my griffin friend's nest is near it.\" You told her.\n\n\nShe whistled, \"You can talk to animals?\"\n\n\nNow is not the time for chit chat. There are three other roads out of the square. Two of them lead out of town but only one leads to safety. Which way will you go?", "action_results": [{"action": "North", "result": "As always, north leads to safety. You two get to your house with no trouble and have a discussion with your griffin friend. It turned out Sparrow's life was much like yours, only more unfortunate. A Black Hand kid raped her along  with his buddies and she managed to kill one of them when they turned around. She had a small amount of magical ability like you and both of you were self-taught and knew defensive magic. Surprisingly, she could talk to animals.\n\n\n\"I saw that like my young friend here, you have had a tough life and are ready to fight for others.\" Solon spoke to both of your minds.\n\n\n\"Yes, Elder we need to find a way to get to Hero's Rise and get out of the way of Pollux's wrath.\" Sparrow responded.\n\n\n\"Please my friend, just as I helped you as an injured fledging, I need your help to get out of a deathly situation.\" You begged.\n\n\n\"I will help, but I cannot get that far. I can tell you to seek out the wizard Mallark. He helped my mother and can get you proper training. I can sense you both have great potential. Now climb on my back.\"\n\n\nYou make your escape, flying over the forest you saw a great many of your magical friends fleeing into the ground near Solon's nest. It wasn't until you passed the forest boundaries that you saw the reason. Pollux had a whole platoon searching for you. Looking up, he saw you on Solon's back and glared as you flew away, Sparrow's arms wrapped around your waist...\n\n\n                                                           * * * * * * * * * \n\n\nPollux's story\n\n\nHe never forgot the boy who humiliated him and used the rage to rise in the ranks of Black Hand to a senior apprentice. He had a large pool of energy for his magic. When he heard his enemy was spotted in the city of Thul he begged his master to rally his old gang to go after the man. \n\n\n\"You fools! You let him get away!\" He screamed at the cowering captain.\n\n\n\"He was spotted heading to the Thul's griffin nest.\" A soldier spoke up with a visible shudder.\n\n\n\"Go after him before I burn you all to a crisp!\" Pollux yelled again.\n\n\nWhen he got to the edge of the forest, the troops were making little head way. It was then that a soldier spotted you in the air. \"Griffin!\" He yelled, throwing himself to the ground.\n\n\nCasting a small spell, Pollux zoomed into the figures on the griffin's back. \"Raven.\" He breathed with contempt. He would return to the city in defeat and have to stay and study for months until he was at least an entry level mage or entry level necromancer. He burned the captain to pure carbon.", "action_results": [{"action": "go into the Rising Sun", "result": "Solon flew through the night, into the rising sun.

This is as good a roosting place as any.\"\n\n\n\"I will find some food all of us.\" You spoke as you strung your bow.\n\n\n\"I'll get a small fire going, and a salad.\" Sparrow spoke, getting out some flint and steel.\n\n\nGoing deep into the forest you got a large rabbit in your bag and a basket of mushrooms. Heading back to your campsite, you heard rustling on your left and right.\n\n\n\"Who's there? Come out or I will shoot!\" You called with an arrow in the string of your bow.\n\n\nTen warriors came out on all sides but their insignia was different than the Black Hand's fist, it was a sun breaking over the horizon. A wizard stepped out from behind a tree. She called out, \"Lay down your weapons!\" Putting your arrow in your quiver, you started out of the circle towards your camp. The group pointed spears and swords at you, axes poised to strike.\n\n\n\"Follow me, I will prove I am not a spy or a simpleton.\" You call as you slide under a man's spear and continued walking. The mage waved the men and women forward, going in the lead with a ball of fire in her hand, just in case.\n\n\n\"Oh!\" Sparrow exclaimed as you walked into camp with your rabbit and mushrooms, throwing it into a frying pan and frying it quickly.\n\n\n\"Raven, you know you should tell me before you bring friends over.\" Solon teased gently into the minds of everyone.\n\n\n\"A griffin? You truly want to join then, and it is an honor Solon, Great Counselor Mallark told us of you.\" The female mage bowed and gestured to her soldiers. \"Return to Hero's Rise all of you. Tell them I think I found the one, they will know.\" Being born on the day of the prophet, you knew nothing of the old prophecy, mostly because it was not spoke of in your village due to the many staunch Black Hand supporters.\n\n\n\"Please join us... Miss?\" Sparrow questioned as she pulled out a plate and cup.\n\n\n\"My name is Molly, apprentice fifth rank. My father is Mallark.\" She spoke, spreading out a bedroll.\n\n\nAfter a long discussion and Molly repeating the words of the prophet, she inquired about your birthday. You told her how it was the winter solstice. You and Sparrow went with Molly to the top of a hill a few miles away and saw a massive hidden city with Solon in a large griffins nest, already made in a tree by a massive castle. \"Hero's Rise.\" You breathed.
