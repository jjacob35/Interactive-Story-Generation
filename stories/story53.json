I\u2019m surprised she only paddled you and didn\u2019t have you kicked out of the school permanently.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well it didn\u2019t even hurt. My dad beats me harder than that. Though I guess Tom thought it hurt with the way he cried! Hahahaha!\u201d David taunts.\n\n\u201cShut up David!\u201d Tom exclaims.\n\n\u201cSo are you playing Smash Sphere over in the park today?\u201d David asks you.\n\n\u201cI hope so, but my dad\u2019s been on my case about me studying harder. Says he wants me to make something of myself when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sucks. My dad is always either at the mines or drinking at your dad\u2019s place. The only time I have to worry about him is when my mom tells him about something I did, then I get a beating. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d survive it if he was always around.\u201d David replies.\n\n\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t beat me, but she\u2019ll yell and throw me into a small dark closet without food if I do something bad.\u201d Tom says.\n\n\u201cYour mom is one scary ass dyke, Tom. My dad said he saw her scare away a mountain troll in the mines once.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up David! My mom\u2019s not a dyke!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes she is! What about that other lady that lives with you then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just mom\u2019s roommate! She needs a place to stay so she helps around the house, like cook dinner or clean up. Mom is at the mines all day, so she can\u2019t do that stuff, so it works out. She\u2019s kind of like a live in maid!\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds more like a second mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nAs much as you enjoy Tom\u2019s na\u00efve defense of his lesbian mother and David\u2019s taunting of it, you arrive at the Inn where you say goodbye to your friends and tell them you might see them later.\n\n\n\nAs soon as you get in, you dad calls you over to the bar.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo do you have any homework?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not due until next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, well if it\u2019s not due until next week it must need a lot of attention, better get started on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not that much dad, I can do it over the weekend. I\u2019m going to go out and play smash sphere with David and Tom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that what you think? Better cancel that idea. You\u2019re hitting the books, besides I vaguely remember you mentioning you were also going to have test next week too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut dad!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dad me! You\u2019ve been letting your school work slide lately and getting into trouble at school with those two little hoodlums you hang out with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not hoodlums, and I didn\u2019t get into trouble today!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be getting into trouble in the first place! Look son, I know you think I\u2019m being hard on you, but this really is for your own good. Your little friends don\u2019t have fathers that give shit about them, I should know because David\u2019s dad is in here all the time and as for Tom, well the less said about his situation the better.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re getting out of here today, but you make one last attempt.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I really don\u2019t have that much homework, I really can do it quick over the weekend!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if that is the case, you can help me out here instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my barmaids is sick and I\u2019m expecting a full house here tonight due to it being one of the miner\u2019s birthdays today, so you can carry food and drinks.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou certainly weren\u2019t expecting that.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t mom do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is going to have her hands full attempting to cook the giant cloudspeak ram in the kitchen for the celebration, in fact you can start off by helping her chop up the beast.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs usual your dad has given you no \"choice\" at all.", "action_results": [{"action": "Resign yourself to doing your homework", "result": "Well, you\u2019d rather not do any real work and lying and sneaking out is probably just going to get you into more trouble.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do my homework!\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cGood choice son. Make sure you lock the door to the private quarters as usual.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou head upstairs to the third floor where your family has their own living space and lock the door.\n\n\n\nYou get started on your homework to get it out of the way so you\u2019ll at least have the weekend to enjoy. As you go through it, it\u2019s a little more difficult than you thought it would be and it was probably good that you have given yourself a lot of time to work on it.\n\n\n\nA few hours pass and you\u2019re finally finished. Your dad might be right; if you\u2019d paid more attention in class your homework wouldn\u2019t have taken as long. It\u2019s too late now to go out and play even if you were allowed, but that still doesn\u2019t mean you have to do anymore studying tonight.\n\n\n\nYou spend the rest of the night playing with some of your toy soldiers and reading a few of your copper dreadfuls. You sometimes can hear some of the louder drunk miners using a bunch of curse words in an amusing way. Eventually you fall asleep.\n\n\n\nThe next day you wake up early, your parents are still asleep so you grab some cookies before you go out to play. You run into Quincy on the way to David\u2019s house.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, where were you yesterday? You missed all the excitement!\u201d Quincy says.\n\n\u201cYeah, I had to go my homework. Damn, I knew I was going to miss a good game of smash ball!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not that! David and Tom got arrested!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! After we played a few games, we all went to the sweet shop. Well David and Tom tried to steal some of the candy and when Mr. Blek saw them, they ran off with it! They didn\u2019t get far though. From what I know they spent the night in Juvie Hall!\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is surreal to you. Your dad was right again. You wonder if you would\u2019ve went along with them and gotten in trouble as well if you\u2019d snuck out yesterday. You can always say now that you wouldn\u2019t have, but who knows at that moment?\n\n\n\nOne thing is for sure; you\u2019re not going to hang out with those two on a regular basis anymore.\n\n\n\nYears pass\u2026\n\n\n\nThe day is finally here and you\u2019re heading off to Klyton University. All your hard work has finally paid off and your parents couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow remember, I\u2019ve been saving for your tuition since you were born, but remember why you\u2019re there. To learn! I don\u2019t want you getting caught up in wild parties and failing your classes. Maybe the upper class kids with super rich parents can afford to, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind your father, have some fun when you can. We know you\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor the most part you do, accomplish the right things in your days at Klyton University. You study, you make contacts, you make friends, and in your free time you have fun.\n\n\n\nYou initially thought you might be \u201clooked down on\u201d due to your working class background. While there are a few like you here, a university education is still expensive and generally only the rich can afford to send their children there. Still, you managed to get here, you (and your family) must have earned it, and so you\u2019re treated with respect.\n\n\n\nYour years at Klyton University are busy but happy ones. You can only imagine that when you just started you pre-med courses that more of the same would\u2019ve come about, however that\u2019s not to be\u2026\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re in your dorm when you get the message from a courier.\n\n\n\nYour father has died of a heart attack. Happened suddenly last night while he was working and by the time a physician arrived nothing could be done to save him. You sit down in shock for a brief moment and when you finally gather your strength, you catch the next coach to the Miner\u2019s Mug Inn.\n\n\n\nWhen you arrive the Inn is closed, so you let yourself in to find your mother who is unsurprisingly upset. You console her as best you can for the time being and help make the funeral arrangements.\n\n\n\nYour father didn\u2019t want an expensive funeral, so it\u2019s a small one. The Inn\u2019s staff is invited along with a few of the miners that were genuinely friends with your dad. Everyone pays their respects before dear old dad is put into the ground.\n\n\n\nOn your way home with your mother, you suddenly realize you\u2019ve missed a couple classes during all this. You then start to wonder about your future college plans and while it\u2019s still a fragile time for your mother, you need to ask her about it when you get home.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know it yet, but you\u2019re in for more shocking news\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "The long talk", "result": " \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re selling the inn?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to! I can\u2019t run this place myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what you have staff for!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh son\u2026(sniff) I don\u2019t think you know the entire situation. You haven\u2019t been around as much over the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I always meant to visit more, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. In fact I\u2019m glad you had fun at college. You at least had some enjoyment. I\u2019m just sorry you won\u2019t get to have any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, I don\u2019t like where this is going.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou mom at this point begins cry again until you eventually get her to calm down. What comes next almost makes you cry though.\n\n\n\nWhile your father did indeed save for you, it wasn\u2019t enough to put you through college completely. Costs were higher than he thought and even though business was okay, he had unexpected expenses such as making fixes to the inn and price hikes in his alcohol supplier.\n\n\n\nYour father was determined to not pull you out of college though, so he found another way. He borrowed money from a moneylender.\n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT?! Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I could\u2019ve taken less classes or gotten a part time job at the university!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t want you to worry or get distracted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s good since all that worry can go to this now! By the gods, why didn\u2019t he at least go to a bank to get the loan!?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried, but didn\u2019t get approved. They wouldn\u2019t even take the inn as collateral. I pleaded with him not to borrow money from criminals, but he claimed it would be fine as long as he opened the tavern earlier, found a cheaper supplier and made a few cuts here and there. And for a while things were running a little smoother, but I could see the stress taking a toll on him. It\u2019s what ultimately killed him. I\u2019m just so sorry that we failed you. We wanted so much better for you. Now I\u2019ll have to sell the inn off to pay off the moneylender and hopefully I\u2019ll be able to find a job as a cook elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou just sit in silence and try to wrap your head around all of this. Your bright future in medicine as you know is gone. You still have quite a bit of education, and you\u2019re fairly certain you could still find a job to support yourself, but it\u2019s going to be hard initially and you probably won\u2019t be satisfied with it. You\u2019re also worried about your mom, what if she can\u2019t find a job? You won\u2019t be able to help her much.\n\n\n\nYou can only think of one solution.\n\n\n\n\u201cWould it help if I ran the inn?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d your mother replies.\n\n\u201cWould it help if I helped you run this place. I mean granted I don\u2019t have excessive experience, I have watched you guys do it while I grew up here. I think I can manage the basics. If we managed to keep this place running at least long enough to pay off the loan, maybe then I can save enough to finish my education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know son, I mean\u2026I would love to see you finish your education, but it\u2019s a lot to take on. Would you have time? I don\u2019t want you getting burned out and suffering a pre-mature heart attack like your father because of the stress!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to have nothing but time now, if I drop out and focus on this place. I think the main concern is getting us out of debt\u2026just how much do you owe?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026about ten thousand gold coins.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou really hoped it would be significantly less than that.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m guessing he takes smaller payments to buy you time but then charges more interest with each passage of time. We\u2019ll have to get this place whipped into shape so it\u2019s making enough profit that we\u2019ll be able to pay the entire sum as soon as possible. After that, we\u2019ll have some breathing room.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour mom looks apprehensive about all this and then shakes her head claiming she can\u2019t let you shoulder this responsibility especially with the risk of physical danger involved if you anger the moneylender in some way.\n\n\n\nShe says that you should go on with your life and forget about the inn, she\u2019ll be able to sell it and pay off the debt with no problem. And as for her, she also tells you not to worry about her either, but she hopes that you\u2019ll forgive her and your father for failing in giving you the life you deserve.\n\n\n\nIt is true you could walk away from all this. You don\u2019t really have any great desire to run the inn. It was just a solution you came up with to help your mom and possibly help yourself. But there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s going to work, just like there\u2019s no guarantee that you can\u2019t still achieve your goals on your own.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take over the inn", "result": "You shake your head; you can\u2019t walk away from this. Your mom might be in serious trouble because this loan. Selling the inn might not even be enough to cover it and even if it is, she probably won\u2019t have enough to fall back on.\n\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t angry with her, but you do feel a little anger towards your dad for getting her in this position (and you indirectly). You realize he still had the best intentions for you, but those don\u2019t really help right now.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright first things first, who is the name of this loanshark?\u201d you ask your mother.\n\n\u201cMr. Reynolds. He\u2019ll be coming next week to pick up a collection. He\u2019s not a member of the Crimson Talons, but he does have a couple of their goons working for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Crimson Talons? Oh geez, this just get better\u2026okay how is this place doing for business?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing about as well as it always has.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be enough, we\u2019ll need to get more people in here, or cut costs somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell your father was going to have more work done on the rooms in the hopes that it would keep adventurers and maybe even merchants to come back whenever they travel through here. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it though. Adventures don\u2019t care where they sleep half the time and it\u2019s not always a sure thing that they\u2019re going to live long enough for repeat business. As for merchants, I think this place is a little too blue collar for them most of the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said something about getting a new liquor supplier?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the one here raised their prices, it would actually be cheaper to get the stuff shipped in from Hessla. Your father was supposed to meet with the new potential distributor in a couple days, so I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going to go through, if at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the staff?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff is working on minimum wage as it is, we\u2019ve got three barmaids, Rita, Eliza and Wendy and they\u2019re all disgruntled about their jobs, but they all still work well.. We can barely pay them though, and we might have to fire one of them.\n\n\n\nGrim stuff, but you\u2019re determined to see this through. Since the liquor supplier from Hessla won\u2019t arrive in two days you\u2019re just going to focus on what you can do now.\n\n\n\nFixing the rooms is still a good idea to keep potential returning wandering adventurers happy. Spending a little money now could increase potential profits later. Who knows, maybe even a merchant will show up and spread the word that this place isn\u2019t just some place where miners get drunk.\n\n\n\nFiring people sounds like it might save you money, but all it\u2019s really going to do is create more work for the rest of you, so you decide to hold off on firing anyone for now.\n\n\n\nYour mother doesn\u2019t agree with your idea of fixing the rooms, but seems relieved that you\u2019re not firing anyone.\n\n\n\nThings go as normal at the inn. Several of the miners still offer their condolences about your father and are surprised to see that you\u2019re taking up his mantle as it were, but other than that they don\u2019t say to much to you. They probably don\u2019t know what to say since while some of them might know you since you were little, but you\u2019re not really \u201cone of them\u201d in terms of education level. Not to say they\u2019re all a bunch of grunting idiots, but they probably figure you\u2019re used to talking about things of a more cerebral nature. You don\u2019t mind though, after all your main concern is getting your mom out of debt.\n\n\n\nTwo days pass and the supplier from Hessla arrives. He\u2019s a grungy shady looking individual, but considering he\u2019s from Hessla that\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\n\n\nHe immediately says his name is Calwin asks for your father at which point you tell him he died recently. Calwin shows no sympathy and merely complains that he\u2019s made a trip up here for no reason. You show a little restraint and call your mother to speak with him, but after five minutes with him she\u2019s ready to throw him out the door for hitting on her, and you\u2019re not exactly thrilled with him either at this point.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook folks, if you want good quality alcohol at a low price I\u2019m willing to deal wit ya, but I\u2019m gonna need some incentive for my troubles because y\u2019all seem like a buncha uptight prigs. Now I was invited here by the man who ran this establishment, so you called me here, if my help ain\u2019t wanted, I\u2019ll be on my way\u2026\u201d Calwin says.\n\n\n\nWhile you\u2019re tempted to just have him leave, you decide it would be best to at least see if his stuff is any good.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright prove it. Surely you\u2019ve brought some of your alcohol here so we can test to see if it\u2019s any good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I do have some with me, but I can\u2019t just be givin\u2019 this stuff away for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be compensated.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou call attention to the miners in the room and ask them if they\u2019d like to try some new beer, naturally they\u2019re all for it. A few of the miners take their fill of Calwin\u2019s beer and they say that it\u2019s different from what they usually drink, but it\u2019s just as good.\n\n\n\nCalwin looks a little put off that they claimed his alcohol is \u201cjust as good\u201d, but still maintains that it\u2019s better than what you already have. He states his price, and also mentions that he wants a free room whenever he comes here since he\u2019s apparently got a harpy of a wife at home and he likes to stay away for a couple days before having to go back to Hessla.\n\n\n\nYour mother obviously isn\u2019t thrilled with having to deal with him, and in the short time he\u2019s been here; he\u2019s also hit on every one of the barmaids. Granted they\u2019re used to such behavior, he\u2019s particularly revolting. (Plus he\u2019s from Hessla)", "action_results": [null, null, null]}, null, null]}]}]}
