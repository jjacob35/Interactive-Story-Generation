Fortunately for you, your wildest dreams came true just last week. You finally received your long overdue promotion, and now you are the official Captain of the Guard!\n\n\nLyestra is a quiet enough village, so the first few weeks were rather uneventful. However, two days ago, you received a tip that a group of goblin warriors had been spotted camping out in the woods not far from Lyestra. Goblins rarely come so near to a village, so you and a handful of other men have gone to scope out the situation. So far, you have found nothing. You are running low on supplies, and the men have requested to return to Lyestra.\n\n\nHowever, you told them you would like to make one last sweep of the area before you return home. You and your men have split up to search the area for any sign of the goblins.\n\n\nYou are on your own, in a dense area of the woods. You are searching for any sign that the goblins were here.", "action_results": [{"action": "Search behind a nearby bush", "result": "You get on your hands and knees, hoping to find a clue underneath a nearby bush, but alas, all you get for your trouble is a dirty uniform.

There appears to be an arrowhead embedded in the trunk of the tree. You yank it out. It seems that it was once attached to an arrow, but someone has snapped off the shaft, leaving just the arrowhead. There is a small white feather attached to the arrowhead. You pull it off. It appears to be decorated with a strange symbol, the likes of which you have never seen before. A red, two headed cobra has been painted onto the feather. The symbol fills you with dread.", "action_results": [{"action": "Place the feather in your pocket", "result": "You feel that you've seen all you can here.

A good thing, too, because at that moment, Adonis, official messenger of Lyestra, comes hurtling through the bushes.\n\n\n\"Arakhan!!\" He nearly collapses to the ground with relief and exhaustion. \"Thank the gods I've found you!\"\n\n\nAdonis is panting heavily. He bends over, trying to catch his breath.\n\n\n\"Calm down,\" you say, \"What seems to be the problem? What are you doing so far from Lyestra?\"\n\n\n\"Lyestra?\" Adonis gets a hollow, far off look in his eyes. \"Lyestra is...now don't take this too hard, but--\" he swallows. \"Lyestra is gone.\"\n\n\nYou nearly sink to your knees. Lyestra? Your home town, gone?\n\n\n\"What do you mean? Tell me, NOW!\" You are barely able to choke back your panic and grief. Your village needs you now more than ever. Now is the time to keep a cool head.\n\n\n\"Goblins came in the night---we---we weren't ready for them,\" Adonis chokes, \"And so many of them! They just kept coming! In hordes!

How could you have let this happen? You've failed Lyestra, and nearly a hundred people have paid for your carelessness with their lives. You've failed your guards--your guards! You have to find them. They must be scattered around the woods--somewhere nearby. You have to find them before a troop of goblins finds them first!\n\n\n\"We've got to get back to Lyestra,\" Adonis continues, \"There might be a few survivors left. And we have to find out who was responsible for the attack!\"\n\n\nYou weigh your options. If you go with Adonis now, the two of you could conceivably make it back to Lyestra in two hours. However, there are still a few guards doing their final sweep of the area. They could take care of themselves, surely, but you would feel much better knowing that they are safe in this uncertain time.\n\n\nAdonis looks at you expectantly. What will it be? Find your guard regiment?

The town has been completely gutted.\n\nSmoke billows from the wreckage of houses. You hear wailing in the streets.\n\nCorpses line the streets, and a few wanderers roam freely, searching and crying out for their loved ones.\n\nNever before have you felt like such a failure.\n\n\"HALT!\" A voice cries, \"Who goes there?!\"\n\nYou raise your head and see a short, stocky man in a helmet approach you.\n\nIt's Quent, one of your guards.\n\n\"Quent!!\" You cry, \"It's me, Arakhan.\"\n\n\"And me!!! Adonis!!!\" Adonis screams.\n\n\"We've returned,\" you say.\n\nQuent lowers his spear and begins to cry, his brave front completely lost.\n\n\"Oh, Arakhan,\" he sobs, and wraps his arms around you. \"You're back!! It was---it was a living nightmare....\"\n\n\"Where are the other guards?\" you ask, gripping him by the shoulders. \"Where are the others we left posted here?\"\n\nHe sobs, choking.\n\n\"All dead, Arakhan,\" he cries.\n\n\"Brutus? Carissa? Andrey?\" You ask.\n\n\"All of them!! They were cut down, every last one. Killian forced me to hide so someone would be left to tell you what happened. I ran, only to see him get shot down as well. Arakhan, they came at us like a wave of death.\"\n\n\"Stand tall, Quent,\" you say. \"I've come to kill the one responsible for this.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you're back,\" he sobs. \"Please, head into the town and see what you can do for the villagers. They need someone. And maybe you can find some of the answers you need in there.\"\n\nYou nod, and release Quent to return to his patrol duties.\n\nAdonis approaches you.\n\n\"Well, I hope you're satisfied,\" he grumbles, \"Some protection.\"\n\n\"Move along, Adonis,\" you growl, and he yelps.\n\n\"Erk! I--uh--right, then. I'll be on my way,\" he mumbles, and shuffles off into the city.\n\nYou glare, watching him go.\n\nAfter a moment, and a chance to catch your breath....you enter the city gates as well.\n\nAt long last, you are home.", "action_results": [{"action": "Enter Lyestra", "result": "Home.\n\n\nOr what remains of it.\n\n\nYou wander through the streets of Lyestra, barely even recognizable after such brutal destruction.

The mayor's house looms in the distance, black smoke plumes rising from it and lifting into the sky.\n\n\nWorst of all are the bodies.\n\n\nYou cannot tear your gaze away from the corpses lining the streets, the sobbing that wracks every alleyway, and the stench of hot blood and fire that fills the air.\n\n\nYou see not a few familiar faces among the dead, and, nearly choking on your grief, you press on.\n\n\nEventually, you find that you have traversed the length of the entire village, and you now stand at the North Gate.\n\n\nThe great wall that surrounds your village has been cracked, and furniture and lumber has been haphazardly barricaded into the broken sections.\n\n\nThe Gate itself is wrapped deeply in chains, with an enormous bronze padlock sealing the chains tight.\n\n\nA man staggers over to you, his eyes glinting malevolently.

Your mission is to find a key, exit through the North Gate, and take your revenge on the monsters responsible for this attack.\n\n\nBut perhaps you should explore the town a bit. Not only will you be likely to find a key, you may also find more information you can use to defeat the mysterious attackers.\n\n\nYou consider your options.
