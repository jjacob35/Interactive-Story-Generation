The town was large but not big enough to be a city, not that it matted to you since your world is mainly your home and the small yard around it. For most of your life the idea of going out into the world made you uncomfortable, along with the idea of social interaction. Of course when the situation called for it, like getting food or mailing a letter at the post office, you could handle it no problem, but you found it joyless and were glad when it was over. In addition you rarely watched TV or even the news on the internet, unless it was happening on your property it didn't affect you or at least that's what you believe. As for money you work from home on your computer fixing problems on other people's computers via remote desktop connections. The company you work for pays enough so you have enough food and pay the bills. What is most important is that they leave you alone while you work.\n\n\nYour little sister Victoria says you do want to go out and do more, but you're afraid. Victoria is your main source of social interaction and the only person who have any real connection to. Several years ago, your parents died in a car crash and Victoria has been living with you ever since. The two of you get along for the most part, you have the same squabble that all siblings have but you genuinely care for each other. It's summer now and in the fall Victoria is leaving for college, which is going to leave you more alone than ever. Oh sure, she is going to visit and stay here between semesters, but you know this is the beginning of her going off to forge her own path and living her own life, something you never got around to doing.\n\n\nAlas you are happy for her and would never want to hold her back. Certainly you would not want her to live the same dull and somewhat depressing existence you have. You do wonder if she is right and you do want to go out in the world and make friends but the fear is simply more than you can handle, while giving up and crawling back into bed is just too easy. If Victoria is right then what exactly are you afraid of? Not being able to fit in, or perhaps it's the shear unpredictably of life. It doesn't make a difference as you have no plans on changing your lifestyle in the foreseeable future.\n\n\nYou wake up late one morning, planning on spending the day working, you head into the narrow hallway and into the kitchen. The kitchen is cramped and needs to be cleaned soon, as you brush crumbs off the kitchen table you notice something is off. It's relatively quiet, normally when you get up Victoria is making noise doing one thing or another. She can't still be asleep, she was always an early bird, maybe she is feeling ill, you decided to check on her as you head back into the hallway and knock on her bedroom door.\n\n\n\"Vic, you alright?\" You call out while knocking.\n\n\nNo response, you open the door just a tad to peek in and see her bed is empty. After this discovery you head back into your room and grab your cell phone off your dresser. There are no text messages or voicemail, Victoria always leaves one when she heads out. You send her text asking where she is. Several minutes pass and there is no reply. Victoria is glued to that phone and she always responds quickly, even though it's usual a text to stop bugging her. You begin to worry, but perhaps you're being overprotective. Your sister is an adult and unlike you has a life, although this is a big departure from her usual behavior. Her best friend is Moira Estacado, she owns the bar and restaurant \"Moira's\" located in the center of town. Maybe she would know where your sister is, or you could search Victoria's room, there might be something there you could find.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to Moira's", "result": "Moira Estacado is Victoria's best friend and a mother figure to her since your mother died. She's a bit older then Victoria which made her instantly cool in your sister's eyes. The fact that she owned a bar and restaurant just increased the cool factor. Personally, you can't stand her, she's obnoxious, annoying and in general a pain. Vic tries to explain that Moira likes to tease and it's just harmless fun, but you aren't convinced. Still if there is someone who would know where sister is it's her. You leave your house and get into your car noticing that the rust on the hood is beginning to spread.\n\n\nA bit of drive later you arrive at Moira's, it's still early, but you know she will be there. Moira is very dedicated to the bar and restaurant, always making sure it is running smoothly and her workers aren't slacking off. She spends as much time there as you spend secluded in your house. There is plenty of parking as it's too soon for the lunch crowd. After parking your car near the front you head in and see the waiter and hostess talking to each other, not expecting a customer so soon after opening. They seem a bit puzzled by your presence and attempt to interact with you, but you're focused on asking to Moira about Victoria and ignore them. You spot her at the bar cleaning a glass, her shoulder length red hair makes her stand out easily. She notices you approaching and a mischievous smile appears on her face. \n\n\n\"Well look who decided to crawl out from under a rock,\" Moira greeted. Her attitude was already getting under your skin, but you had to see if she knew about Victoria.", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Hello Moira, nice to see you\"", "result": "\"Hello Moira, nice to see you,\" You manage to say without showing how annoyed you are at her greeting.\n\n\n\"Wow, who are you and what have you done with Ben?\" Moira responded, getting you more annoyed.  \"I mean not only did you leave your house, but you're talking without sounding like a dick.\"\n\n\n\"Look, I can't find Victoria, can you tell me where is she, she's not answering her phone and I just want to make sure she's alright.\"\n\n\n\"Will you relax, she's probably still at Steve's house, they left here together last night.\"\n\n\n\"Who the hell is Steve?\"\n\n\n\"You mean you don't know, wow just wow, Victoria always said you were a bit obvious to things, but I didn't know it was to the point where she can date a guy for a month and you remain completely clueless.\"\n\n\nThe mention of Victoria having a boyfriend caught you off guard. You're pretty sure Victoria never mentioned him, maybe she was worried you'd get upset or maybe simply she never told you because you never asked. Are you really that withdrawn? Now is not the best time to worry about this, it's better stay focused on finding her.\n\n\n\"Are you sure she's there?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"I'm not positive but it makes sense, last night Victoria was here for a bit then Steve came and picked her up, I assume she spent the night there since she isn't at your house,\" Moira explains.\n\n\n\"Why would she spend the night there?\"\n\n\n\"Jesus, are you really that socially inept, do I really have to explain why she would spend the night at her boyfriend's house?\"\n\n\nYou ponder for a second and then as the realization hits you, a look of disgust appears on your face.", "action_results": [null, null]}, null]}]}
