Yes, it is indeed a dark and stormy night, but darker and stormier and maybe just a tad more purple than your run-of-the-mill dark and stormy night.\n\n\nSomewhere deep in the forest a unicorn frolics in a magical glade, as elves watch and scamper amongst the trees, polishing their bows with the blood of dwarves.\n\n\n\u201cKilled a big fat one today, Elfrond,\u201d says Elfmoor. \u201cBastard was trying to chop down a cherry tree. Can you believe it, a fucking cherry tree? Sacrilege.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever wondered why we hate the dwarves so much?\u201d asks Elfrond.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? They\u2019re fucking dwarves! And this one chopped down a tree. A cherry tree. Only thing that rivals my love of trees are cherries. And music. And song. And like five other things.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve just been thinking lately. How did we get these sweet bows, if we didn\u2019t chop down a tree to shape them. And how do we burn fires without firewood? And why exactly do we hate the dwarves?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s canon. Don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a cannon?\u201d\n\n\nSuddenly, the elves quit bickering. Something that only happens once in a thousand years occurs. The glade explodes with magical aura as the unicorn releases its legendary rainbow fart. Magical anomalies, such as this, signal only one thing: the birth of a hero.\n\n\nElfmoor takes a big whiff of the magical aroma. \u201cB. E. A. Utiful. Times like this make life worth living.\u201d\n\n\nElfrond shakes his head. \u201cElfmoor, we\u2019re immortal. I\u2019ve seen this like ten times already. And every time this happens, it means something evil is about to come afoot.\"\n\n\n\u201cBut the hero always wins.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the term collateral damage?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that a sword?\u201d\n\n\nAnd there you have it. The magical unicorn fart that marks your birth. How exciting! I wonder what type of hero you will grow up to be.", "action_results": [{"action": "Heroic knight, heroic knight!", "result": "Ah, the noble knight in shining armor. And they say chivalry is dead.\n\n\nYou are born into a loving but stern peasant family in the hamlet of Forest Hill. Your formative years are a medley of hardship, merriment, and hard work. While most of the other children in the hamlet are content to play ragamuffin children\u2019s games and live out their lives in this quaint corner of the woods, you aspire to greatness, spending every evening selling turnips and every night mucking shit from the stables. With all this (paltry sum of) loot, you are able to afford sword and shield lessons from the guardsmen.\n\n\nOne fine autumn evening, you and your sword master Jon are finishing a sparring session.  Jon is bigger and faster than you are, but you have taken his lessons to heart. Training swords are blunted, but they hurt all the same when they whack you.\n\n\nJon\u2019s sword arcs toward your shoulder. You raise your shield, and the wood splinters. With a quick twist of the wrist, you yank the shield downwards, catching Jon\u2019s sword in the process. He is open; here is your chance. You swing your sword\u2026\n\n\n\u201cDodge!\u201d you shout, dropping to the ground. Jon\u2019s fist sails an inch above your head. You toss your shield and lurch from your knees into Jon. The pair of you grapple on the ground. Dust flies. Both of your swords are lost in the ruckus.\n\n\nA fist catches you square in the gut. Once, twice, three times. You spit in Jon\u2019s eyes and roll to the side, and stagger to your feet. A leg comes sweeping toward you.\n\n\n\u201cDodge!\u201d you shout, jumping back. You avoid the leg, but tumble onto your ass. Before you can regain your feet, a boot hits your chest, shoving you back into the ground.\n\n\nJon stands above you and smirks. \u201cYou know what you forgot to do?\u201d\n\n\nYou nod, knowing.\n\n\n\u201cYou forgot to DODGE!\u201d\n\n\nYou share a hearty laugh. At first, Jon would shout \u2018dodge\u2019 to train you to avoid taking hits, now it is your job to shout it when you train. He even sends kids around to throw shit at you randomly during the day. That really sends the message home. You have come so far that the art of dodging has almost become a sixth sense. \u2018If they can\u2019t hit you, they can\u2019t kill you,\u2019 Jon had reasoned.\n\n\nThe pair of you head to the watch house to clean up. The building is small and reeks of sweat and mildew. The hamlet only has three guards, so upgrading their housing has not been a top concern of the local Baron. You are just thrilled the hamlet has guards at all.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting good, kid. Real good,\u201d says Jon, stripping his leather armor. \u201cI think you\u2019re ready for some real patrol work. We just got a report the other night about some disappearances on the Baron\u2019s Road. It\u2019s probably just some bandits, but we need to take care of it. You in?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Hell yeah I'm in.", "result": "\u201cHell yeah I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\n\nJon nods. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d\n\n\nThis could be your big chance to finally prove yourself. You need to get your name out there if you want to have any chance of receiving a knighthood someday. They do not just hand those things out like\u2026 well, nobody has ever actually handed you anything except a nice big steaming pile of shit. Peasantry blows.\n\n\nUnder cover of darkness, you and the three guards head out along the Baron\u2019s Road in the back of a covered wagon. No one has ever thought of ambushing bandits in a covered wagon while guised as merchants. Surely, the plan will go off without a hitch.\n\n\nSamwellington the Fat jitters in his seat. You are not sure if it is because he is scared or hungry. How Sam became a member of the guard is beyond your imagination. Jon trusts him for some reason, and that is good enough for you. \u201cNervous kid?\u201d he asks.\n\n\nThat you might eat me. \u201cNo. If Jon says I\u2019m ready, then I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\nBowie bobs his head. \u201cIt\u2019s best to trust Jon. I didn\u2019t once and then my world went to shit. That draugr attack during the winter of \u201969 was brutal\u2026 I still have nightmares.\u201d\n\n\nJon rolls his eyes. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t st-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey, let\u2019s let bygones be bygones,\u201d says Bowie.\n\n\n\u201cHey do you hear that?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, my stomach rumbles when I travel,\u201d says Samwellington.\n\n\n\u201cNo, not-\u201d\n\n\nThe horses whinny and bolt. One of the wheels catches a snag in the road and topples over. Luckily, you land on Samwellington\u2019s gut. Jon cuts a hole in the wagon covering and climbs out into the night, and you and Bowie follow.\n\n\n\u201cOh, fuck\u2026\u201d Jon clutches his sword in both hands and rushes.\n\n\nTwo trolls tower over the corpses of the horses and the wagon driver, tearing chunks of bloody flesh with the effort you would rip apart a boiled chicken.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Jon.", "result": "In your eagerness to fight at Jon\u2019s side, you forget the most important lesson of your training: always dodge.\n\n\nA troll whips a horse leg in your direction. Off balance and off guard, you cannot avoid the hurling limb as the hoof nails you in the shoulder, severing your sword arm. Blood spouts like a geyser from your body as you crumple to the road.\n\n\n\u201cBowie, help Jon!\u201d Samwellington shrieks. \u201cI\u2019ve got the kid.\u201d Samwellington stumbles to your side and rolls you onto your back. \u201cHang in there little buddy. It\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d\n\n\nBlood loss is making you delusional. It is the only way to explain what is happening. Samwellington draws his dagger and sticks himself in the gut. He drags the blade across his stomach, slips his hand into the incision, and pulls out a chunk of his own fat. He smacks the lard on your wound and it sticks in place, stemming the blood flow.\n\n\n\u201cCan you walk?\u201d asks Samwellington.\n\n\n\u201cCan I walk? Can I walk! I just had my fucking arm cleaved off. What the fuck do you think?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, an arm, not a leg. Don\u2019t be a baby.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSam we could really use your fat ass over here,\u201d shouts Bowie. \u201cAny motherfucking time!\u201d\n\n\nYou hear a gurgle and a gasp just before Bowie\u2019s head goes sailing through the air. Samwellington gulps and scurries away to hide behind the wreckage of the wagon. What a coward. Oh well, at least he saved your life.\n\n\nLeaning against your sword, you stagger to your feet. One of the trolls ravages Bowie\u2019s headless corpse. The crunching and snapping of bones sickens you, and you fight the urge to hurl as bile tickles your throat. Jon appears to be holding his ground against the other troll, but once his friend finishes devouring Bowie\u2019s corpse, even Jon won\u2019t be able to fend off their combined savagery. You have to do something quick or all of your worthless lives will be over.", "action_results": [{"action": "Throw your severed arm as a distraction.", "result": "You doubt you will be of much use as a combatant, so you may as well make yourself useful in some other fashion.\n\n\nYou grab your severed arm and wing it as hard you can toward the trolls. The troll feasting on Bowie ignores the bloody mess of flesh, but Jon\u2019s troll clambers after it on all fours. A deep sadness seeps into your bones as you hear the troll crunch your arm in its jaws. Heroes are not supposed to be eaten.\n\n\nJon slices the back of the trolls\u2019 knees, and the troll howls in agony as its legs buckle. Jon leaps onto its back and cleaves the head clean off with one swipe with your arm still clenched between its teeth.\n\n\n\u201cGo Jon,\u201d Samwellington cheers. The fat coward is still cowering behind wreckage from the wagon.\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and help?\u201d you snarl.\n\n\n\u201cI am helping. I\u2019m providing emotional support.\u201d\n\n\nYou roll your eyes and look back in time to see Jon finish off the second troll.\n\n\n\u201cWow, that was fast,\u201d you say.\n\n\nJon shrugs. \u201cA little emotional support can go a long way. Nice job yourself. You didn\u2019t even need to have your sword arm attached to the rest of your body for it to be useful. Try dodging next time though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will be a next time. How can I fight without a sword arm?\u201d\n\n\nJon winks. \u201cI know a guy: magic fellow and what not. He should be able to do something for you.\u201d Jon raises his hand. \u201cHold on one second. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\nJon darts into the forest and you hear the lovely sound of steel biting into flesh and the accompanying screams.\n\n\n\u201cSam, why don\u2019t you go back to the hamlet and draft the report,\u201d says Jon, emerging from the forest, \u201cadd five dead bandits to it. I\u2019ll take our buddy here to the hedge wizard.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, you and Jon part ways with Samwellington and enjoy a relatively droll venture to the hedge wizard\u2019s hut. You understand why he is only a hedge wizard. The hut is a ramshackle smattering of twigs and leaves that appear to be held together by nothing but mud and bird poop. The entire place smells worse than a popcorn fart. This may not have been the best idea, but before you can raise your concerns with Jon, he hollers out.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Osprey, get out here. I need a favor.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs that you Jon?\u201d You hear weird pops and bangs from inside the bird poop hut. \u201cJust a second.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTake your time,\u201d says Jon. \u201cNo hurry.\u201d\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, a bent white-bearded man with smoldering eyebrows and a staff teeters out of the hut amidst a cloud of smoke. The smoke shrouds Osprey and follows him around. It smells of rancid cheese and burning bird shit.\n\n\n\u201cWhew,\u201d Jon attempts to wave the stink away, \u201cwhat were you doing in there?\u201d\n\n\nOsprey\u2019s eyes light up. His lips twist into a smirk as he cackles. \u201cWizard things.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, Dear God.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey\u2019s smile vanishes as he notices you and totters over. He grabs your head in both hands, lifts your chin, peers into your eyes, and prods your chest with a bony finger. A chill courses through your bones. He proceeds to violate your personal space for several minutes while you do your best to avoid suffocating in the smoke.\n\n\n\u201cMmhmmm,\u201d he says to himself. \u201cJust as I thought. The boy is missing an arm.\u201d\n\n\nYou roll your eyes. \u201cHow observant.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey whacks you upside the head with the staff. \u201cMind your manners, boy, or I\u2019ll turn you into a leprechaun.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing sadder than a leprechaun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot even a smelly old man living in a bird shit hut?\u201d\n\n\nOsprey clobbers you with the staff again. \u201cI\u2019ll have respect from you boy. This is no joking matter. You ever see a leprechaun you give that poor bastard nothing but your sincerest sympathies.\u201d He smacks you with the staff one more time for good measure. \u201cNow about that arm. I can fix you right up. Get you a brand new ethereal arm. Those things are sweet: impervious to physical damage. Magic will fuck you up though.\u201d\n\n\nOsprey begins nodding his head and drawing weird symbols in the ground with his staff while mumbling to himself.\n\n\n\u201cJon,\u201d you whisper, \u201cI really don\u2019t think this is a good idea. This guy is cracked.\u201d\n\n\nJon scoffs. \u201cPosh. You want to be a knight, right? Well, a knight needs both arms.\u201d", "action_results": [null, null]}, null]}, null]}]}]}
