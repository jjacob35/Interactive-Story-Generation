He developed a so called \"sense for mischief\": he \"accidentally\" burned  down the house of their neighbors, he \"mistakenly\" freed almost 200 pounds of fresh, still living fish, he never slept at home in his teenage years, preferring a hidden cave on the shore, and he always wanted more.\n\n\n \n\nAfter leaving Altheria, he lived for a few months amongst the beggars in the city of Empyria. A powerful wizard used a magical artifact, called \"Nearyk's Death Orb\", or simply, the \"Orb of Death\".\n\n\nThe wizard destroyed half of the city, before getting killed by an arrow. Bren quickly took the orb and hid away for three months. When he returned, his mind and soul was consumed by the powers of the Orb, and he marched through the gates of Empyria with the sole purpose of ruling it. He stormed the castle and destroyed the entire army of the Western federation, then overthrew Commander Andrew Ice from the throne of the Federation and started a reign of terror.\n\n\nAfter years of mindlessly using the Orb, the artifact's powers started to fade , failing against Bren's continuous instability, and for the first time in history, the Orb was devoid of magical powers.  Not losing even one day, Commander Andrew Ice retook the throne from the now powerless Bren, putting a large reward on his head.\n\n\nAfter the orb regained a dime of it's power, Bren used it to take the throne again, and this continuous back-and-forth between the two leaders brought Andrew on the brink of losing his sanity. Desperate, Ice commanded his soldiers to kill Bren on sight, thus disobeying one of the most sacred laws of the Federation, the one that stated  that no former leader of the Federation shall be killed.  Word spread easily through the federation, and a civil war started between those who supported Andrew and those those who deemed that he broke the laws.\n\n\nDriven insane by the continuous chaos, Andrew blamed Bren for the civil war and left the Federations, tracking Bren with a large fleet of those still loyal to him.\n\n\nNow, Bren hoped to get help against his arch-enemy from his homeland, but their refuse dismayed him. Using the last powers of the Orb to bend the will of the altherians, Bren now hopes that it will be enough to put an end to Commander Ice's pursuit.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n============\n\n\nDanny looks desperate.

You barely reach a cave in the forest where you used to play as a child.\n\n\n\"Ah, good times!\" That would make a perfect planning spot.\n\n\nYour skills as a mage, mostly necromancy, are limited, but the Orb offers you full control over the army of zombies.

You, on the other hand....\" You say, noticing the curse you placed on Andrew back on Empyria, that causes him to age faster in your presence, takes full effect right now.\n\n\n\" Nice choice of last words! You may have cursed me to age faster in your presence, but that won't be enough to stop me! You will pay dearly for destroying  Empyria! Surrender now, or face the wrath of the true leader of the Western Federation!\"\n\n\n\"You're on my land now, Commander! Your reign is over!\"\n\n\n\" You just signed your execution, traitor!\" said Andrew charging at you. You place the Orb on the ground and defend yourself with the daggers you took from the village.

When King Albert XIX passed him the throne, Andrew had to accept.\n\n\nUnder Andrew's command, the Federation expanded it's territory greatly, and strengthened relations with the other major human faction, the Dumadian Empire, while also establishing a trade agreement with the Elves.\n\n\n \n\nOnly peace and prosperity could be in the prospect... until a mad wizard chose to use a powerful Artifact, the Orb of Death, against the Federation's capital, Empyria. The wizard was slain, but the Orb was nowhere to be found. Shortly after, another man appeared, carrying the Orb. The man proved to be Bren Stone, from Altheria. Bren managed to do what the wizard did not, and took over the entire Empire by force, overthrowing  Andrew.\n\n\nKnowing that any attempt to regain the throne while Bren still has the Orb would mean certain death, Andrew waited for an opportunity... and after eleven years, the opportunity came, when the Orb was drained of powers.\n\n\nAndrew didn't lose any second and took the throne back. Another three years of chaos  followed, as the throne was taken back by Bren almost every second month, and then back by Andrew the months between.\n\n\nDesperate, Andrew broke one of the head laws of the Federation: he put a reward on Bren's head and ordered that he would be killed on sight. A civil war started between those who supported Andrew and those who wanted him punished for breaking the laws.
