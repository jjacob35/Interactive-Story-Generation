The reason why it has to be you is because you must be the Phoenix Rider if you wish to marry Aercaena. If you do not regain the Sword of Light, then you will no longer be eligible to marry Aercaena.

By using Space Magic, you can travel faster and farther across the face of Anaria, the only downside being that you can only create Gateways to locations that you've been; no shortcuts to Redinor's lair for you. You've never had much affinity for Water Magic, and your father gave up trying to teach it to you long ago, so Kerinettory doesn't even bother mentioning it.\n\n\nBefore the feast begins, you put on your favorite tunic, leggings, and strap your falchion to your belt.\n\n\nLeaving your room, you make your way down the stairs to the dining hall.\n\n\nUpon entering, you find your entire family, except Naric, and all of your friends gathered together around the vast tables, every delicacy known to you and more upon the tables.\n\n\nSoon you notice that not only are your family and friends here, but so is the Imperial Family.

I am running out of options here.\"\n\n\nYou remember learning that the Fairy race shares a unique connection with Anaria, being able to feel the pain inflicted by wars and pollution. This ability is their greatest strength and weakness. If Anaria was engaged in a war that engulfed the entire planet, then it would drive the Fairies to extinction.\n\n\nYou breathe out a sigh of relief, glad that the discussion isn't about you and Aercaena. However, you fear for Naric and Mariannai. Their relationship is like your's and Aercaena's.

Your father is holding Erroniki within a Time Field, preventing the Fairy King from moving, but not restricting him from conversing.\n\n\n\"Because Warrenfreid wants one of my eldest,\" Erroniki exclaims. \"Almost all of them are gone. The Fairy-Demon War resulted in, as you well know, the assassination of almost all of them.\"\n\n\n\"Then give him your last one,\" your father demands. \"Mariannai has bonded with Naric. The Dwarf race constantly wants new goods. If he was to see her, he would know that she is no longer a maiden; he would see her as used, not by him, but by an Elf. Dwarves are insensitive; Erroniki, if you feel any anger towards me, you should know that I speak the truth. You are aware of the civil war that resulted from a Dwarf princess coming to meet her betrothed, only for him to see that she had unwillingly violated. He turned her away, while he felt no anger towards her, and turned on her brother. The bloodshed that followed nearly destroyed the Dwarves. Such an occurence would have ruined Anaria. If the Fairies were destroyed, then the Demons would be allowed to run rampant across Anaria, killing everything in their wake. Don't take my son's happiness away, or you will have a war on both fronts. Do not underestimate the power of the Elvish Empire, and do not think that you can break the friendship between Vorinar and Warrenfreid. Should you declare war upon us, there will be an alliance between Dwarves and Elves of such Anaria has never seen.\"\n\n\nErroniki's angry expression fades away. \n\n\n\"You are right, Aaron, as you have been so many times before,\" he says calmly. \n\n\nDeciding that you've intruded long enough, you and Aercaena slip away.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Finally, you and Aercaena arrive at your room.
