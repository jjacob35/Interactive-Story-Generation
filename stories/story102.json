You are the lowest form of life in Carney society. You\u2019re not a real performer; what you do can\u2019t really be considered a skill. You\u2019re not even a real freak. At least a deformed freak can evoke an emotion of horror, or pity, or even admiration for overcoming their condition. You weren\u2019t born \u201cthis way\u201d. You chose to do this. All you evoke is disgust and revulsion. At best you\u2019re laughed at and not in the good way like those pervert clowns you work with.\n\nFuck all that \u201cWildman of Borneo\u201d shit that the Ringmaster tries to tell all the rubes. You\u2019re little more than a bum with a \u201cjob\u201d. A degrading job that involves you to debase yourself, all for the amusement and shock value of others, but hey it keeps a \u201croof\u201d over your head and you pleasantly drunk enough to just barely forget how utterly pathetic your life is.\n\nYou are the GEEK.\n\nYou wake up to a bucket of piss being thrown in your face. Not the first time and certainly won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\u201cYou like the taste of that Geek? Get up Geek! The Ring Master wants to see you!\u201d Charley orders then he throws the empty bucket at your head. The comical sound it makes hitting your skull and the pain it causes makes Charley laugh.

You smell even more disgusting than usual! I guess that\u2019s one way to keep Ajax from killing you, he\u2019d probably vomit his guts out before he could lay a hand on you\u2026then you could lick it up for the rubes! Ha ha! Move it Geek!\u201d\n\nCharley prods you with a sharp stick periodically on your way to the Ring Master\u2019s trailer until you arrive at which point, Atlas stops the both of you.\n\n\u201cStop! What business do the both of you have here?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit you fuckin\u2019 one eyed freak! We go through this all the fucking time and its getting REALLY old! You just saw me come out of the Ring Master\u2019s trailer earlier today when he sent me to get the Geek, you know damn well what we\u2019re both doing here!\u201d\n\nIgnoring Charley\u2019s comments Atlas looks down at you and points.\n\n\u201cYou may enter, but the Ring Master doesn\u2019t need to see you again, so you may not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, whatever enjoy the smell.\u201d Charley says and mumbles something to himself while leaving the area.\n\nYou barely make it up the little steps to the trailer, but you do. You\u2019re finally starting to gather your wits together; your head still hurts though and you\u2019ve just realize you haven\u2019t had a drink yet. What a terrible feeling. You open the door.\n\n\u201cClose the door, you\u2019re letting all the sunlight in.\u201d the Ring Master orders from behind his desk. She\u2019s siting in his chair, but has her back turned to you.\n\u201cUh you wanted to see me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course\u2026(Sniff sniff) you really haven\u2019t been taking care of yourself. If anything you\u2019ve become even more repulsive than when I first took you in. Remember that day?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yeah I think\u2026no, no I don\u2019t. I mean kind of\u2026 I forget things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised; you\u2019re constantly drinking that swill Charley makes. I am surprised you haven\u2019t gone blind yet though. Oh well what you insist on doing to yourself is of little concern to me, all I require is your obedience. You are thankful for all I have provided for you aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. Sure I am.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be one of the few nowadays then. There are some though that are ungrateful for things I\u2019ve done for them, they plan to betray me and everything this carnival stands for. They plan to change the natural order of things. Can you imagine what might happen to this carnival if I wasn\u2019t here? What might happen to you?\u201d\n\nYou attempt to think about this scenario, but instead you just stand there because you can\u2019t really form anything in your mind because it hurts really bad, you\u2019ve been sober too damn long, and it\u2019s about to get even longer as the Ring Master seems intent on bombarding you with talk as he finally swivels around in her chair. That pale androgynous face of the Ring Master\u2019s is displaying a look of seriousness as usual.\n\n\u201cNothing good I can assure you. Which is why I\u2019m putting YOU in charge of this task.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What task?\u201d\n\u201cWhy ensuring the survival of the carnival of course.\u201d\n\u201dWhat!? Me?! Why? How!? I\u2019m not qualified! Can\u2019t you or Charley do it?\u201d\n\u201cI fear I\u2019ve done all I\u2019ve can. I mean I\u2019ve provided all of THIS to everyone here. I\u2019ve given them purpose and a life. If that isn\u2019t enough for them, then my words aren\u2019t going to make a difference at this point. And as for Charley, well\u2026I\u2019m sure even in your usual state of drunkenness you\u2019re aware that he has his own plans for this carnival.\u201d\n\u201cI guess\u2026but agh, it\u2019s too early for all this\u2026why me? I mean what am I supposed to do? I\u2019m just the Geek.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m choosing you. You have no motive, you have no agenda, you have no friends, and as such you would probably be the best candidate to convince others to resist change and keep the status quo.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to be joking! Nobody\u2019s going to listen to me! I\u2019m the fucking Geek!\u201d\n\u201cYou might be surprised, you have far more potential than you give yourself credit for\u2026perhaps you\u2019ll even change some perspectives, or maybe not. The choice is yours, because the fate of THIS carnival is resting solely on your actions, you can no longer afford to hide from the world in a bottle and a cage if you wish to keep your current life. It is time for you to take some responsibility, its time to repay the debt you owe me. You have until show time.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow leave me, I wish to be alone.\u201d\n\nThe Ring Master swivels his chair back to its original position. You head back outside, where upon Atlas blocks it again with his massive body.\n\nNever before in your life have you been put in this kind of position of responsibility, (Not that you can remember anyway) but you\u2019re going to have to do something, the question is what exactly?", "action_results": [{"action": "Obey the Ring Master", "result": "You feel you don\u2019t really have a choice in this situation.

What a terrible thing. Now you have to figure out who you need to convince.\n\nThe Freaks are firmly on the side of the Ring Master, so you don\u2019t need to talk to them. That just leaves the Midgets and the Normals, both of those present some problems.", "action_results": [{"action": "Try to convince the Midgets", "result": "Charley leads the Midgets and you doubt if he\u2019s going \u201cfall in line\u201d and even if he claimed he was, he\u2019d just be lying. You might even be putting yourself in great danger by speaking to him directly about this, however you know the Midgets don\u2019t really care for Charley, so if you could get him out of the way somehow, they might be more willing to ally with the Ring Master.\n\nYou decide to \u201ctest the waters\u201d by speaking to one of the few Midgets (Actually the only one) that\u2019s somewhat less hostile towards you. You see Bob working on hammering tent stakes in the ground and go up to him.\n\n\u201cHey Bob, can I talk to you?\u201d\n\u201cAw hell Geek, I ain\u2019t got no money for you to get fucking drunk! Just go steal the liquor from that sonofabitch Charley and take your goddamn chances!\u201d he says barely paying attention to you.\n\u201cNo, its not that\u2026so you uh think Charley\u2019s a son of a bitch huh?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it, I know it. Everyone does.\u201d\n\u201cSo why do you guys follow him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he does make things better for us. Better than the Ring Master did anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but what if he\u2019s not the best choice to lead you guys, I mean\u2026\u201d\n\nBob raises one eyebrow and focuses all of his attention on you now.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talkin\u2019 about Geek? You seem to be awfully interested with matters that don\u2019t concern you.\u201d Bob states raising his hammer menancingly.\n\u201cWell um\u2026I just heard that\u2026um Charley\u2026I mean\u2026look there\u2019s some shit gonna go down and the Ring Master wants me to get people on his side!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re unsure of what Bob\u2019s going to do about your revelation. You expect the worst, but for once luck is on your side.\n\n\u201cLook Geek, I ain\u2019t gonna lie to ya, not many of us like Charley, and sure, he\u2019s a fucking tyrant, but he gets things done, I dunno he\u2019s kinda like that guy in Germany, except shorter. However, if he wasn\u2019t around, we\u2019d go back to being second class citizens again and why? We DO keep this place running. The Ring Master claims he cares about us, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way to us. We\u2019re under appreciated. And if Charley does have ideas about taking over, then we\u2019re behind him. Maybe the whole place would be run a lot better with him in charge anyway. AND I suggest you don\u2019t talk to any other dwarves about this, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get the same answer and they might just feel the need to tell Charley about the discussion and I don\u2019t think that would be very good for you.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do or say to change your mind?\u201d\n\u201cGoddamn it, weren\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 listening Geek? I said no! Not unless you found someway of replacing Charley with someone a little more even tempered and with his business savvy.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t one of you midg\u2026I mean dwarves do it?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Because most of us are simple laborers. We just wanna do our job with as little hassle and relax when we can, we don\u2019t wanna be worried about extra shit. Let Charley worry about it since he wants it so bad. Besides if you haven\u2019t noticed he\u2019s got a mean streak a mile wide and that fuckin\u2019 muscle bound freak Ajax around him all the time.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nobody who\u2019d want to take Charley\u2019s place?\u201d\n\u201cNope. The only one I can think of who\u2019d even have the intelligence of running the criminal activity here smoothly anyway would be his overgrown girlfriend Salina. Now her I wouldn\u2019t mind working under if you know what I mean! Hah! Now get the fuck outta here Geek, I got work to do and your smell is gonna stick to my clothes for days! Get!\u201d\n\nYou back away from Bob before he hits you with his hammer or kicks you in the shin.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t what you expected, but perhaps Bob has subtlety shown you a way to get the midgets to ally with the Ring Master, but of course this means talking with Salina. That could be even more risky though, considering she\u2019s the object of Charley\u2019s \u201clove\u201d. Not to mention she doesn\u2019t particularly like you.\n\nBut then again, who does?", "action_results": [{"action": "Go talk to Salina", "result": "You cautiously approach Salina\u2019s trailer, you\u2019re nervous as hell. You stop and hide behind a nearby barrel when you see someone coming out. It\u2019s Sasha. She looks like she\u2019s been crying, probably about Ajax no doubt. Salina seems to be telling her something and then hugs her before closing the door. When Sasha leaves you knock on Salina\u2019s door. She answers.\n\n\u201cLook, I told you\u2026UGH! Its you! Get the fuck outta here Geek! No amount of money is gonna make me degrade myself for your festering ass! And you\u2019re upsetting my snakes with your odor!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, I really gotta talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say that I wanna waste my time OR my sense of smell on, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease it s really important! It\u2019s about Charley and the future of the Carnival!\u201d\n\nSalina raises her eyebrow.\n\n\u201cHmm, very well, but you\u2019re not coming in here, let\u2019s go someplace secluded where nobody can see me associating with you.\u201d\n\nYou and Salina walk to a nearby spot in the wilderness (Separately of course) to talk where you explain the situation to Salina.\n\n\u201cYeah, so what does all this mean to me? If Charley takes over I win and if the Ring Master stays in power I still win. I don\u2019t see why I should get involved in this power struggle.\u201d Salina says unemotionally.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at the big picture. As it stands now you got some measure of freedom, but if Charley wins, this place will cease being a Carnival and become a crime ring. And while you might do alright gift and money wise, you\u2019ll be Charley\u2019s girlfriend full time at that point with little freedom. You know he\u2019s never going to let you do anything without his approval if he\u2019s in power. And if the Ring Master wins, chances are the criminal activity here is gonna be severely diminished without Charley to run it, meaning you\u2019ll probably be making less money.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026but don\u2019t you want the Ring Master to win?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but she needs allies and I\u2019m trying to get the midgets to ally with him and they won\u2019t if Charley\u2019s in charge of them.\u201d\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t understand, what exactly are you proposing? You\u2019re kind of all over the place here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I want YOU to take over Charley\u2019s position. You run all his business dealings.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re crazy Geek.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You\u2019re intelligent; surely you probably know all of Charley\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\u201cWell THAT\u2019S true. The little fucker insists on bragging about everything after sex, but what makes you think the midgets will follow me? I mean I\u2019m a Normal.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019re a tall beautiful woman, the midgets will love you, didn\u2019t you see Wizard of Oz? Just as long as you promise to uphold all the things Charley did like protection from being bullied by rubes and keeping their payment the same, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll mind you in charge instead of Charley. Think about it, YOU could be in charge of the whole operation, and it\u2019s not like the Ring Master will bother you as long as you don\u2019t try to screw with the everyday Carnival workings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never do that, the Carnival has been like a home to me\u2026I\u2026\u201d\n\nSalina seems to stop herself before she displays too much emotion to you.\n\n\u201cAlright Geek, I\u2019m willing to entertain this idea, but you have to do something for ME first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, what?\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta get rid of Randal.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why? What did he do?\u201d\n\u201cTo me? Nothing, but he\u2019s competition and I can\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\u201cCompetition for what?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind, just get rid of him. Think of it this way, if you get him out of the picture, you\u2019ll also eliminate the leader of the third faction here which would really cement the Ring Master\u2019s supremacy here. Surely that should be incentive enough?\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to kill him?!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care HOW you get rid of him, just get rid of him before show time. If you do that, you can tell the midgets that I\u2019ll be taking over Charley\u2019s position when the time comes. Now don\u2019t speak to me again until you do this.\u201d\n\nLooks like you got MORE work ahead of you and you really don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to get rid of Randal. You doubt if just asking him to leave is going to work, and while killing him would solve the problem, it\u2019s not really that simple to just kill a man even if you had it in you.\n\nYou could really use a drink\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Talk to Randal", "result": "You can\u2019t kill Randal, so you\u2019re going to have to just try to convince him to leave\u2026somehow.

Now leave me, we must prepare.\u201d\n\nYou leave Madam Orbec\u2019s tent and go find Randal.

Atlas, if you would be so kind to escort this former employee of the premises\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the Ring Master says that, it typically means \u201cAtlas, after you break his neck make sure the body is properly disposed of.\u201d\n\nAtlas grabs Charley who attempts to defend himself with his sharp stick, but instead it\u2019s taken from him and broken. Then Charley\u2019s spine is taken from him and broken. Atlas lumbers off in the darkness to get rid of Ajax and Charley\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, I trust we\u2019ll have no problems Salina?\u201d The Ring Master asks.\n\u201cNo problems from me, I have all I need, or I soon will have.\u201d\n\u201cGood, I suggest you and your new friends get some rest, we got a big show tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhile Salina and the munchkin brigade leave and the freaks disperse as well, the Ring Master calls you out.\n\n\u201cGeek, you may come out of hiding, I\u2019m sure you can see the danger is over, not that there ever was any.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually worked. Everything\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSee? I told you, you underestimated yourself. Not only did you save the Carnival, but you stabilized it even more. I told you, I saw potential even when there was none apparent. Do you still want to be a Geek? You could be so much more if you just put in the effort. Charley used to do all my leg work, but now that he\u2019s gone I need someone else to fit that role\u2026would you be interested? Keep in mind that this new job would require a whole lot more responsibility and significantly less drinking as I would need you in a better frame of mind.\u201d\n\nAt one time you\u2019d balk, but after seeing what you accomplished first hand, maybe you DO have potential. You accept and you\u2019re given Charley\u2019s old trailer.\n\nTime goes by and you stumble along the way with the first few months as you still have a really bad drinking problem, but fortunately the Ring Master is slightly understanding about that, and only sends Atlas to remind you ONCE to get it under control. (That incident really sets you on the straight and narrow) you get yourself cleaned up and actually become presentable. You\u2019re more of an organizer than a main event now, but you still go ahead and bite some chicken heads off every now and then for the kids.\n\nSalina is a pretty fair and even handed business woman when it comes to the being new leader of the midgets. Much more than Charley, and she also has Pervus and his clown crew eliminated during one night. Apparently they got rough with one of her girls. They were all found dead the next day. Nobody said anything outright, but the fact that little snake bites were found on their bodies was a pretty good idea who was responsible. However, the Ring Master said nothing since Pervus and his friends had it coming for a long time, not to mention with them gone things actually improved morale wise. (People tend to work better when their aren\u2019t evil demented clowns lurking around)\n\nYou also see Salina and Sasha get very close in a way that makes you tingle in the nether regions. Now you know why Salina wanted you to get rid of Randal. Without Ajax to kick her around anymore, Sasha probably would\u2019ve fell for Randal (You also found out Madam Orbec told him he needed to leave the Carnival to find some magic book in some Mayan ruins that the spirits commanded him to retrieve\u2026he never returned) but since he wasn\u2019t around, she ended up with Salina. They seem to be happy though.\n\nActually everyone at the Carnival seems to be a lot happier and more relaxed and it\u2019s all due to your actions.\n\nThe Ring Master has given you a second chance at life, a life with a whole hell of lot more meaning.\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten respect at last.", "action_results": []}]}, null]}, null]}, null]}, null, null, null]}]}
