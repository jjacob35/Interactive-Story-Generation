You slacked off all semester and didn\u2019t study for your finals. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to pass your nature magic test tomorrow. Those things are always killers. You don\u2019t even know why you enrolled in that class; you aren\u2019t even interested in being a nature mage. You don\u2019t even like the damn outdoors!\n\nOh wait, you know why, it\u2019s because you saw a cute witch taking the class, so like a dumb ass, you signed up for it. Naturally the moment you tried to impress her with some sort of cantrip, she laughed at you and said even if she was straight, she wouldn\u2019t go for a half assed hedge wizard like you! You really should\u2019ve known better, half of those witches are lesbians anyway. That whole Mother Earth Goddess worship caters to the rug munching. (And no, there aren\u2019t any MALE witches, any self respecting man would call himself a WARLOCK, not a damn witch!)\n\n(Sigh) Like your little sister\u2019s B\u2019ar\u2019b Dolly once said \u201cMagic is hard!\u201d Indeed. Sometimes you curse the day your mother passed her magical elven blood on to you.\n\nStill, you\u2019re here now, so you need to make the best out of your life. You\u2019re already going to hear it from both of your parents of how you\u2019ve been nothing but a disappointment to the both of them. Your Dad will probably do a little more than say that, he\u2019ll probably personally ride up to the University and beat the hell out of you for wasting his hard earned pillaging money to send you there in the first place.\n\nArrgh! You just wish you were good at SOME kind of magic! You have the ability; you just don\u2019t have the focus! That\u2019s always been the problem with you. Your sister has it easy, she took after Dad. Narrow minded focus on killing someone with a blunt instrument doesn\u2019t take too much effort. Of course you had to be the one that greater things were expected of.\n\nYou\u2019ve tried all the schools, evocation, conjuration, illusion, divination; all of them. You can\u2019t excel in any of it. You can only get so far and then the words and gestures and well all of it just becomes too fucking confusing for you.\n\nHowever, you haven\u2019t tried the \u201cdarker arts\u201d, but your Mom would definitely never approve. (Your Dad probably wouldn\u2019t care, but if you upset your Mom, it\u2019s a warhammer upside the head) In fact it\u2019s illegal to study any of them. They caused too much trouble in the past and nearly destroyed the world at one time. All who are known to even dabble in such arts are immediately taken into custody and executed.\n\nYou don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to be summoning demons anyway; even the few \u201cfriendly ones\u201d that work on campus are fucking assholes to the Nth degree. You can only imagine how bad the ones who haven\u2019t been living among mortals are.\n\nHowever there is another dark art which you have to admit you\u2019ve always had a bit of curiosity about.\n\nThe art in question is necromancy.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re willing to at least see if you\u2019re good at ANYTHING, so for shits and giggles you decide to blow off your test which you\u2019re going to fail anyway and go see if you can find out more about this outlawed dark art.\n\nThough being a lazy sort you decide to try the library first.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go make a trip to the library", "result": "Even though you\u2019re supposed to be a wizard in training, you spend as little time as possible in library if you can help it. Normally you just check out whatever you need to read for a class and leave.\n\nYou have little faith in finding anything substantial on Necromancy in there, but maybe you can find something that will at least quell this thirst for knowledge on it. You realize you\u2019re treading on dangerous ground, but you have to try to learn more.\n\nThe library is huge however, and you\u2019re unsure of where to look, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a section on Necromancy or Outlawed Magic, but you figure you\u2019ll look in the History section first.\n\nYou glance and browse through the stacks until you pick up a few choice books that look like they might contain something, sit down in a quiet corner and begin to read. Naturally you don\u2019t learn too much. The history books mainly go on about how bad the Dead War was, important battles, the atrocities of the Lich Lord, the typical stuff you\u2019ve read time and time again. Still, you\u2019re determined to find something new.\n\nYou spend hours reading until you realize you\u2019ve spent the day in the library and that it\u2019s now night time. Oddly the library is mostly empty, and that\u2019s probably because finals are now over, one of which you\u2019ve now undoubtedly failed. You think of how stupid you\u2019ve been to obsess over an outlawed art that you probably wouldn\u2019t be any good at anyway! You\u2019ve only been dwelling on the subject to ignore your own problems that you could\u2019ve tried to solve yourself, instead of fantasizing about being some Necromancer. Raising the dead\u2026what good would that do you? Delusions of grandeur. You wouldn\u2019t have enough motivation to try to take over the world anyway. There was only one person who truly motivated you, and she\u2019s gone.\n\nYou begin to think about Serena and begin to feel sorrow like when you first lost her. You\u2019ve had enough of death. You leave the library in a daze and head back home to sleep off this miserable day.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape though; even your dreams bring death. You dream about Serena. At first she\u2019s alive and vibrant, and then suddenly she dies before your eyes. Then you see her grave with you sobbing over it and shouting how you demand that she not leave you.\n\nThen she rises from her grave\u2026and you wake up only to come face to face with her! She is a ghost floating near your bed.\n\n\u201cHOLY SHIT!\u201d you shout and back up against your headboard.\n\u201cShhhh! Hush my love, I\u2019m risking a lot just by being here.\u201d She says looking around as if someone is going to bust down your door any minute.\n\u201cSerena, what\u2019s going on? This isn\u2019t a dream is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear I assure you that I am very real. And I have a message for you.\u201d\n\u201cA message?\u201d\n\u201cYes, embrace death and all the beauty it has to offer.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to kill myself, to join you?\u201d\nSerena laughs a bit. \u201cNo silly, you are to become a necromancer and bring the purity of death to the world.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026yeah right. With my aptitude of magic, I doubt if I could raise a mouse skeleton.\u201d\n\u201cYou always did lack confidence in yourself. I suppose that\u2019s why they sent me to motivate you one last time. Though I admit, I would\u2019ve come to see you anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThey?\u201d\n\nSerena side steps your question and continues.\n\n\u201cLook we haven\u2019t much time, but you HAVE the ability to become the greatest Necromancer since the Great Lich Lord who brought the world near the brink of extinction centuries ago, but you cannot do it alone\u2026at least not yet. You must have allies. There are others like you on this campus who long to practice the dark arts. Seek them out and take over this college as your first step to your destiny.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Hold on! What makes you think I want to do all this?\u201d\n\nSerena floats closer to you and touches your face with a ghostly hand. You feel completely calm.\n\n\u201cBecause deep down it IS what you want. You know your thoughts are dominated by death. You even think of me rather than living girls and I\u2019ve been dead for years. The very fact that your mind played a part in summoning me here is also proof of your desire.\u201d\n\u201cI miss you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know you do, but my point is, even before I died I remember you having an interest in the dark arts. Indeed it\u2019s part of what attracted me to you. But now I must return and you must fulfill your part in this world, whether you succeed or fail at this endeavor will ultimately be up to you, but I believe you will succeed.\u201d\n\nSerena then floats a little closer to kiss you.\n\n\u201cFarewell, my love.\u201d She says and then disappears.\n\nYou\u2019re now wide awake and pacing the floor. You\u2019ve been ambivalent about pursuing this path before, but the more you think about it and with this visit from Serena, this is the path you\u2019re going to choose. And why not? It\u2019s not like you have any better options in your life at this point.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do it, and though Serena mentioned others like you being on campus, you\u2019re damned if you have a clue to as of knowing who they are since you don\u2019t really socialize. Still, you can think of two people that could get you started. (Or at least not rat on you, when you start inquiring about Necromancy)\n\nThe next day you take your first steps towards darkness\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Go talk to your creepy conjuration professor, Mr. Demar", "result": "Chapter 2: Death Awaits\n\nSerena\u2019s right, you\u2019re going to need the help of others and you head to Mr. Demar\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Demar\u2019s class was probably the only one you didn\u2019t struggle in too much. It\u2019s not really a popular field given that conjuration can lead to summoning demons. Still, there is use for it on a minor level, though of course it\u2019s strictly regulated by most governments.\n\nMr. Demar was a good professor, but the general agreement by everyone in your class, was that he was REALLY creepy. Plus there were always rumors about him. You always got the impression he was interested in doing a lot more with his area of expertise, but had to settle for teaching. He always seemed to be alright with you though.\n\nWhen you get to his office, surprisingly it\u2019s open and he\u2019s busily shuffling some papers around.\n\n\u201cMr. Demar?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What? Damn it, I thought I locked that door! Oh it\u2019s you, what do you want? And lock that door.\u201d\n\u201cWell uh\u2026I had some questions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, what are they? Out with it.\u201d He says continuing to look at some strange parchments.\n\u201cWell, uh\u2026I guess it\u2019s about magic, and I guess um\u2026\u201d\n\nMr. Demar looks up at you like he\u2019s going to slap you for stuttering so much. You finally speak up.\n\n\u201cI want to know more about Necromancy.\u201d\n\nMr. Demar steps back and gives you a few inspecting stares.\n\n\u201cI dunno what you\u2019re talking about, in fact if you don\u2019t get out of here I\u2019m going report you to the dean for asking such questions.\u201d He warns, but you get the impression that he\u2019s not telling the truth. He probably thinks you were sent to spy on him by the dean or something. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t been held under close scrutiny before.\n\n\u201cMr. Demar, I\u2019m not trying to get you into trouble, it\u2019s me! I really want to learn Necromancy, and you\u2019re about the only one I think can help me! I actually was worried about coming to you and I was nervous about the whole thing!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well I guess I always did think you were inclined towards the dark arts and given your annoying stuttering a moment ago, you do sound like you were nervous. Okay, you want to learn? I\u2019ll teach you. I\u2019ll teach you like I\u2019m currently teaching so many others right now. Surprised? Yes, the time is coming to pass that we who are inclined to REAL power begin to make our place in this world\u2026permanently. Though I still have concerns about you, I mean while you did about average in my class, I\u2019m well aware that you\u2019re not exactly the best student in other fields. I question whether you can handle the power of the dark arts, let alone become a Necromancer.\u201d\n\nYou stand up straight and reply. \u201cI\u2019m confident that this is my path.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you said that, because there\u2019s no going back and this path is not for the weak. We also must maintain secrecy at all times until the day that we may take what is rightfully ours. Now come with me, we\u2019re going to see exactly what kind of potential you have.\u201d\n\nMr. Demar casts a spell and opens up a portal. He then prepares to enter it and beckons you to follow him, which you do. Suddenly you\u2019re whisked away into a place of near darkness. Given your immediate surroundings you\u2019d guess that you\u2019re underground somewhere. You can hear the clinking of chains though nearby and moans.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u201cYour testing area, this where we\u2019re going to find out what exactly you\u2019re made of. In the next room, you\u2019ll find some undead friends. They\u2019re currently chained up, but they won\u2019t be for long. Now, you can kill them, but as a Necromancer you\u2019re supposed to be controlling them, so obviously you should try to do that.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how! You haven\u2019t taught me any spells!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to, you\u2019re going to have to figure this out yourself, but I will say this, it\u2019s all about the strength of willpower. Tap into your magical energy and if you have what it takes, you\u2019ll succeed. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\n\nDemar disappears back into the portal and leaves you all by yourself. You\u2019ve really gotten yourself into it and now there really isn\u2019t any going back, and you can hear the chains from the next room dropping to the ground and the moans getting louder and closer.\n\nThere\u2019s a large bone on the ground and not much else in the room, and you can\u2019t run either as there are no other exits.", "action_results": [{"action": "Pick up the bone and defend yourself", "result": "You pick up the large bone and prepare for whatever is coming at you. A couple of zombies enter and as soon as they see you they shamble over.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re a little shaken, and you attempt to do exactly what Demar said, but you\u2019re not having any effect. Soon one of the zombies is almost upon you and you lash out with the bone.\n\nYou give a few good whacks to the first one\u2019s skull causing it to collapse lifeless once again. You do the same to the second one. You\u2019re breathing hard and thank the fact that they were slow enough not to easily catch you.\n\nHowever, your victory is short lived, when Demar appears again.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) you killed them, after I told you that was not the purpose. Plus you gave a poor showing in even attempting to control them. I don\u2019t see a future for you, if you cave under pressure like that.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a little dejected, but the worse is yet to come, when you find you won\u2019t be leaving this place. Mr. Demar can\u2019t risk you knowing about this place yet not being a disciple of his. He didn\u2019t last this long being undetected by taking chances.\n\nWith a few quick mumblings and you feel your body ravaged by rot. It\u2019s a horrible death, but one that results in you rising to take the place of the \u201ctest\u201d zombies you just ruined.\n\nYou spend your remaining undead life shambling around underground until eventually when Demar feels it\u2019s time to attack, you\u2019re one of the first cannon fodder troops to be destroyed in the attempted take over.", "action_results": []}, null]}, null]}]}
