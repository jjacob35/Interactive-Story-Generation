You do not know how much longer you can survive in this place. No one has brought you any food or water for days. Either you've been abandoned to die or something's happened to the guards to keep them from feeding you. Either way you are well and truly buggered.\n\n\nWith what little strength you have, you pick yourself up and look around your cell. There seems to be no way of escape. The window is barred and even if it wasn\u2019t, your cell is at the very top of a huge, medieval tower, so climbing out would be suicide. The door is far too heavy to break down and you don\u2019t have anything you could use to pick the lock. There is nothing in the room save for yourself, a dirty pile of straw in the corner and a bucket for\u2026 Well, let\u2019s not discuss the bucket.\n\n\nSuddenly though, as your eyes scan the dungeon, you notice something you never saw before. One of the stones on the wall of your cell seems to have something etched into it. As you lean closer you can just about make out two words. \u201cPress me.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Press the stone", "result": "You press the engraved stone and a secret door in the stone wall gradually slides to one side and reveals a hidden passage way. Congratulations, you\u2019ve escaped your cell! That wasn\u2019t too difficult was it?\n\n\nAs you follow the empty passage way, you seem to be circling the dungeon and walking deeper and deeper into pitch darkness. Eventually you see a light at the end of the passage and find yourself in a room dimly lit by torches that hang from the wall. The room is small with only a spinning wheel and an old rocking chair to decorate it, both of which are coated in cob webs. There is a door on the other side of the room.\n\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, you head towards the door when suddenly you hear the creaking of the rocking chair behind you. For a brief moment you hold your breath and try to reassure yourself that it\u2019s just the breeze rocking the chair, but there is no breeze in the room. Eventually you force yourself to turn around and see the ghostly figure of an old woman sitting in the chair.\n\n\nBefore you can run or scream, the old lady speaks up in a gentle yet eerie voice. \u201cNo need to be afraid of me child.\u201d She tells you as she slowly rocks in her chair, stroking a small, ghostly cat on her lap. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to fear from poor old Nana. I\u2019m just here, pondering the old riddle to myself. Are you good at riddles child? I do hope so. They\u2019re the only way to get out of this tower you see, ever since the old master went mad and cursed the place. Oh and that reminds me, I\u2019m supposed to ask you the riddle aren\u2019t I? Now let\u2019s see if I can remember.\n\n\n \n\nWhat does man love more than life,\n\n\nFear more than death and mortal strife,\n\n\nWhat the poor have and the rich require,\n\n\nAnd what contented men desire,\n\n\nWhat the miser spends and the spendthrift saves,\n\n\nAnd all men carry to their graves?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Answer \"Love\"", "result": "The ghost lets out a sad and disappointed sigh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not dearie.\u201d She tells you as the rocking of her chair gradually comes to a halt. \u201cI am sorry child. At least you tried.\u201d\n\n\nSuddenly a trap door opens up beneath you and you fall screaming into a pit of fire. Personally you find this punishment a tad eccentric just for failing to answer a riddle correctly, but that's just you.
