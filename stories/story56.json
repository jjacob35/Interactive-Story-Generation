You can still hear his cold, baritone voice explaining it to you. Vampires in the tales of Fantasy are glamorized; nigh-immortal, sexually desirable, powerful. But, while you suppose you are some of those things, in truth, you are not much more than an albino with a lot of health issues. The sun, he said, will damage your skin more than anything else. Any sort of foodstuff can't be digested anymore by your barely functioning bodily systems. He claims to have an idea of what the 'Professor' was trying to do to us, but for whatever reason, he has dodged the questions anytime you ask.\n\nAny information other than that, Kelso hasn't revealed. The irking thing is that it is obvious he knows what's going on, but he consistently acts as if it is in your own good you don't know what went on.\n\nThe nights have been hard since your escape from the Facility. Most nights you wake up shivering, after all the nightmares you've been dealing with. It's terrifying, and it only makes you wonder what horrible things were done to you at the Facility. You do know that they must have affected your ability to feel. No, not the wishy washy 'emotional' garbage you'd usually expect, but your sense of touch was dulled. While a lot of your senses have been heightened, that one stands out. You feel very little pain from your feet, which is odd; considering how you spent your time running over cracked glass just two days ago, but it seems to have healed recently.\n\n---\n\nWaiting. It should be sunrise by now. Kelso said you shouldn't get out, as you are a creature of the darkness now. He, on the other hand, has been out for the entire night and then some. You're not sure what Kelso is hunting for, but you know that you're beginning to get thirsty. More and more questions begin to build up, and no doubt the bastard won't answer half of them. Even while you ran with him through the night, running across various landscapes. Most are just a barren dessert, though every once in while you'd pass a half-buried house like this.\n\n\"Bright lights up ahead.\" He said. A city only several miles down. Kelso must have gone there for the clothes he mentioned, but you hope he's safe....", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue waiting inside for Kelso", "result": "A sigh leaves your lips as you ruffle your hair with your hand. Now scratching, several hairs fall off. Perhaps not too unusal; trivial, even. But things like this interest people in boredom. That, and the twitching of a certain fly beside the table. Twitch. Twitch. Twitch.\n\nIt's annoying. Your nose flares as you continue to sit. Sleep isn't what it used to be either, more like an odd sort of meditating. Besides that, your senses continue to ring as the fly takes to the air around you. It lands, and you feel a faint tickle on your cheek-- And you catch the damned bugger. Nothing but your hand moved, a small action was all it took to take the flies life. You didn't even mean to kill it immediately, though you don't mind it's yellow ooze. Without feeling it, you squished it. Threat destroyed, you put your fingers to your temples and try to meditate.\n\nAlmost immediately, your mind begins to drift...\n\n---\n\n\nCome on, wake up!\n\n\"Wuh? What's going on? Who are you?\"\n\nWe can formally reintroduce ourselves later damnit, the lab is falling apart!\n\nThe lab? What lab? Why the hell am I in a lab?\n\nI'll explain everything once we're safe. But we need to go. Now.\n\n\nIt is then when your eyes adjust enough that you can actually view the chaos that surrounds you. The red, flashing lights give you just enough light to make out cracked capsules with smelly liquid pouring out from them and flooding the floor. Looking even slightly up, you can see your own smashed container, as well as the pillars supporting the ceiling riddled with cracks. An odd assortment of humanoids seem to be sprawled out on the floor, with several still writhing and creeping sluggishly.\n\nBut besides all this, you don't really feel much, considering. A numbing liquid surrounding and licking at your sides, but not much else. You can't even recognize your own heart beat. Then again, that's quite possibly due to the tension and commotion. Perhaps you were numbed while in that storage container.\n\nThe man beside you seems to still shaking you, though it takes you several seconds to notice. Grabbing you by the hand, he begins to force you up and drag you along until your legs begin to feel enough to move. Although still sluggish, your motor controls seem to be working better than whatever you could remember. Finally, you feel like you can resume mumbling out questions, even while hurtling around breaking pillars and stumbling on broken glass.\n\n\nWhere... where are we going?\n\nOut. The Zealots of the Church may come in any moment, so we need to evacuate.\n\nThe Church? I... Can you at least tell me your name?\n\nStop talking. Just run.\n\nHow do you expect me to trust you if I don't even know who you are?\n\nI'm not sure you know who you are either, right now it's best you trust me and shut the hell up.\n\n\nAnd you do. Thinking about it, you really don't remember who you are. Who you were? It's... blank.\n\nThe man's hand is outstretched, motioning you to hold on and follow.\n\n---\n\nA sudden crashing noise awakes you from your revelation.", "action_results": [{"action": "A uniformed man appears.", "result": "Out of nowhere, a humanoid with flashy armor leaps at you. Fearful, you quickly send out a powerful jab, lamely clunking on his armor as he topples on top of you. You expect him to attack, or continue the assault, but he appears to be as dazed you are. Although the metal armor is heavy, you're able to throw him off of yourself, hearing a splintering in the wooden floor as he lands.\n\n\"I'm here.\"\n\nIt's Kelso. His striking features resemble an older gentleman. Whitish blonde hair and a gruff voice, though perhaps with a slight German accent-- almost grandfather-like. \"Master, where were you? What... is this man doing here?\"\n\n\"C.E. Agent, member of the Church and Special-Forces Unit for taking care of our kind. You need to kill this filth.\"\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, \"What? I dunno... Ugh. No, Kelso. He's just, like, doing his job. I think? No, it doesn't matter! What's going on?\"\n\n\"His job is to murder Creations, government is after us and the rest of the-- the Professor's creations. We're not safe. Which, is why you need to kill this officer. You need to get used to this before it becomes more common to handle.\"\n\nThe soldier slowly looks up at you, scrambling to get up. \"You two... speak? Lord in heaven, the damned speak!\"\n\nYou can imagine his eyes would be widening right about now, but his entire body is covered in the metal suit, flashing with electric blue lining, his helmet with a black visor. The figure, now up, begins to scramble for a rifle-like object, but Kelso gives a heavy slap to the back of his head, sending the man flying forward, his helmet flying off in a different direction.\n\n\"Kelso, Creations? What the hell is going on? Tell me!\"\n\n\"First, kill him.\"\n\n\"I'm really not sure about this...\"\n\n\"Kid, I know you're hungry.\" It's true. \"This is the only thing you can feast on.\"\n\nYou just stare in disbelief, shaking your head. Kelso stares at you for a moment before turning around and kicking the operative in the side. You hear a dent and a crack, likely his ribs were smashed along with his armor.\n\n\"Let's get your questions over with. Now. You need to decide what you'll do with him.\"\n\nYou take a deep breath, just shocked at everything that's transpiring. After mumbling and scratching your head, you think you know what to ask.", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Why the hell do I need to eat this man?\"", "result": "Kelso sighs with an apparent annoyance. \"You're not eating him. You're going to drink his blood. I've explained this before.\"\n\nHe sort of did, but it doesn't exactly make it better. He told you that you couldn't digest any food, but he never mentioned you'd have to digest blood!\n\n\"I... I drink his blood... from the neck?\" Your knowledge about supernatural creatures is more or less non-existent, give or take whatever nerdy things you might have dabbled in high-school. Unless you were some sort of jock before then. You don't remember...\n\n\"Not necessarily. The wrist works too-- as long as you get a stream of blood in your mouth you'll be satiated. This should be easier as things go along though, since any sort of infirmary should have some blood packs for transfusions, and those are easily broken into. And you can always drink non-human blood... But this is necessary. Oh, and do remember to watch out for the diseased, bad blood isn't good for yor system.\"\n\n\"Ugh... Do we really have to kill him?\" You ask with a frown.\n\n\"Unless you want him to call upon the rest of the C.E. Crew on our asses, then yes. Either way, you need to be full before we leave this shit hole. We have work to do.\"", "action_results": [null]}, null, null, null]}]}]}
