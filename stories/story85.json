I know now that the circumstances were out of our hands and that you would want me to be happy, but I've lived with this guilt for so long. I need to share you with everyone...", "action_results": [{"action": "Into the past...", "result": "You haven\u2019t eaten anything since early this morning and the walls of your stomach are grinding together. You have to get your mind off of it somehow and the water fountain on the far wall beckons to you.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the road for days and it feels like the better part of it has been planted in this seat\u2014even though you\u2019ve only been here for the last couple of hours. The skin on your back and the backs of your bare legs rip free of the hard plastic seat as you stand and your flip-flops slap and smack your heels as you plod across the room.\n\nYou freeze midway when you see a cowboy roping a calf from horseback. It\u2019s the most wonderful thing you\u2019ve seen for days even if it is only a poster. And it\u2019s not the only one! Scanning the room you see many, many more of far off magical places with waterfalls and cliffs and mountains and dark caverns. Some of cityscapes with towering buildings and some at night with only the lights on and still more of endless rolling plains.\n\nFrom somewhere behind you, you hear a garbled voice fighting it\u2019s way through crackling static, droning on and on about things that only old people care about. You zero in on the source and discover that it is a tiny coin operated radio affixed to the arm of a terminal seat. Neat!\n\nJust then a clammy hand clamps down on the back of your neck and you\u2019re whisked toward the double glass doors. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go, mister,\u201d comes the all too familiar voice of your mom and she only releases her grip\u2014with a surprise thrust that causes you to whack your shin on the bottom step\u2014to allow you to clamber up and into the bus on your own.\n\nA shiver runs down your spine and the back of your arms prickle as you make your way down the aisle between tall and comfy-looking seats. You\u2019re not used to air conditioning and it brings both pain and relief.\n\nYou pass by an elderly couple. The woman looks up and smiles at you warmly so you give her a wide berth. You doubt that she would, being a stranger and all, but you sure don\u2019t want her squeezing your cheek like Grandma does.\n\nYou\u2019re nudged into the row behind them and you take the farthest seat. Your mother sits beside you and puts the bag with everything the two of you own at her feet. Her lips are pursed and her eyes drawn. She\u2019s been tired every day since the divorce and when she gets tired, she gets mad. You have a hard time even recognizing her now.\n\nA hiss and a lurch later, the bus pulls out onto the highway and with your face plastered to the side window you watch as the fence posts strobe past with only the occasional bush or sapling breaking the pattern.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d remarks the old man to his wife, \u201cand it looks to be a bad \u2018un.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d she replies absently, not bothering to look up from her needlepoint.\n\nYour eyes drift upward from the fence to a draw on the horizon and there the sky is beginning to boil and bristle with blue-white sparks. You can\u2019t shake the feeling that you are at the very beginning of the greatest adventure\u2014and worst nightmare\u2014of your life.\n\nAfter only a mile or two, the droning of the engine and the rhythmic beat of its tires thumping over the seams in the concrete soothes you to sleep and you sleep the whole rest of the way.\n\n\n\nYou are shaken from a pleasant dream of opening Christmas presents with your parents to stumble and trip over your feet as you\u2019re dragged toward the front of the bus. It pulls over, dumping the two of you out on a deserted street.\n\nYou know it\u2019s only your reflection, but the ghastly and pale boy is all you can make out in the store window before you. It brightens and fades, brightens and fades with each pulse of the stoplight on the corner. You take a step backward and the wind from the bus pushes you forward as it pulls away.\n\n\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to get yourself run over?\u201d Your mother cups the back of your head and shoves you toward the boy with hollow eye-sockets, \u201cGet over there and sit down against the wall.\u201d\n\nYou do as your told, although you can\u2019t help but look up at the glass expecting him to be standing there looking down at you.\n\nAn eternity goes by with your mom standing slumped against a signpost and staring off into the night.\n\nYour butt burns as the bones chew their way to the cement. You rock slowly from one side to the other to relieve the pain and she flashes her eyes at you. You melt.\n\n\u201cSit there and don\u2019t move,\u201d she barks as she leaps toward the flashing light. A car has stopped at the corner and she waves her arms as she sprints toward it. It begins to pull away, but stops short and the window tentatively rolls down.\n\nYou can\u2019t make out her words, but there\u2019s happiness in your mother\u2019s voice again as she crouches there with her elbows propped against the car door. Maybe she\u2019s not mad anymore. You stretch your legs out as far as you can and wiggle your toes.\n\nShe stands as the car pulls away and turns toward you. You can\u2019t see her face, but there\u2019s no mad in her walk now. You let out a long breath in relief.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve found us a place to sleep tonight,\u201d she beams snatching up the bag, \u201cand tomorrow I start job huntin\u2019. We\u2019re gonna do jus\u2019 fine you an\u2019 me. You wait an\u2019 see.\u201d She wraps her arm around your shoulders and the two of you skip off around the corner and into the crisp night air.\n\n\n\nYou sit with your shoulders slumped, dragging your feet in a circle as the swing\u2019s chains lazily wind and unwind and then wind up again. You\u2019ve already walked around the park twice and sat on everything here so now all you can do is wait.\n\n\u201cYou wait here an\u2019 watch our stuff,\u201d your mom had told you, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to do today an\u2019, with any luck, things\u2019ll be a whole lot better from now on. And don\u2019t you leave the park! You hear me? I\u2019ll be back as quick as I can.\u201d\n\nYour stomach grumbles. The two half-crushed cheese and peanut butter crackers your mom gave you before she left didn\u2019t do much to satisfy it. At least the gnawing emptiness is gone.\n\nYou hear a squeal and giggles so you look up. Some little kids are playing in the dirt at the bottom of the slide as if it were a sandbox. A dozen steps away from them sits a plump woman with her nose in a book.\n\nYou survey the park for other signs of life and spot a group about your age. Three boys in a circle around a dark-haired girl. They\u2019re pushing her back and forth between them like some demented form of \u2018Hot Potato\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d jeers the fat one.\n\n\u201cYeah, you ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere you little bastard,\u201d cracks the snotty runt.\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d she hisses, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d\n\nThe tallest of the three quakes from head to toe and nearly loses his breath in a fit of really annoying breathy laughter as he shoves her back toward the other two.\n\nThe girl turns beet red from anger and lashes out with flailing, non-connecting slaps which only seems to feed the boys\u2019 hysterical laughter.\n\nYou have the sudden urge to attack them, but that might be a little hasty. Perhaps you should find some other way.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wade into 'em", "result": "\u201cLeave her alone!\u201d you command as you trot over to them with more brass than you really possess, \u201cYou like picking on little girls?\u201d\n\nTheir shock fades instantly when they see you and Chortle begins to jiggle. They either aren\u2019t that impressed by you in the slightest or they\u2019re extremely good at hiding it.\n\nChortle grapples the girl as Tubby strides up to you, heeled closely by Snots. You suddenly feel smaller and more helpless than at any other time in your life, but you refuse to show any sign of it.\n\n\u201cWho are you?!\u201d demands Snots.\n\n\u201cIs this your little girlfriend?\u201d jeers Tubby, \u201cHave you come to rescue her?\u201d\n\nYou feel your face flush red, but not from embarrassment. You are livid!\n\n\u201cLook here, this guy\u2019s here to save his bastard girlfriend,\u201d spits Snots.\n\nYou lunge forward and Tubby grabs you in a meaty \u201cbear hug\u201d, but not before you put your fist in Snots\u2019 mouth. He falls back in horror with a tooth dangling below his upper lip and starts tearing up.\n\nTubby swings you around in an arc and falls on you with every ounce of his weight knocking the wind completely out of you.\n\nYou struggle against his massive frame, kicking and thrashing, but there is no escape. It\u2019d take a bulldozer to move this tub o\u2019 guts.\n\nHe crawls upward and pins your arms with his fat legs and starts drilling your forehead with his meaty finger. \u201cWanna be a tough guy, huh?\u201d\n\nThe girl manages to land one of her backward kicks and Chortle falls like a sack of potatoes, screaming in agony as his face goes purple. She turns and darts between two houses on the far side of the street.\n\n\u201cGet her,\u201d wheezes Chortle, \u201cGet that little bastard!\u201d\n\nSnots runs to his aid and tries to pull him to his feet between sobs, but can\u2019t muster the strength. Chortle is in no condition to stand just yet anyhow.\n\nTubby turns back to you and pounds a couple of stinging blows to the side of your face, then smooshes your head into the soft earth as he hoists his lard back to his feet and saunters over to his friends.\n\nYou roll onto your belly, push yourself up and limp away in the other direction.\n\nLooking over your shoulder to make sure the trio aren\u2019t watching, you dash between houses and start making your way back toward where the girl went through.\n\nThe alley is shrouded by trees arching overhead and you make your way to the end of it. Seeing no sign of her, you cut through to the next street. Still nothing. She\u2019s long gone.\n\nYou suddenly remember the bag tucked under the picnic table that you were supposed to be watching. If something happened to it, you\u2019ll be in big trouble.\n\nYou sprint like the devil is after you. A hedge claws up your arms and face as you dart through it, which you barely even notice.\n\nTurning down the alley, a dark figure steps out from behind the corner of the hedge directly in your path. Your mouth goes all coppery and dry, and you skid to a stop.\n\nYou\u2019re all set to flee when you realize that it\u2019s the girl from before. She looks sheepish and a bit winded, but no worse for wear.\n\nShe hangs her head, but her eyes remain fixed on yours. As you cautiously approach her, you detect the faint hint of a smile.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she barely more than whispers.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYeah. They didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure hurt that one.\u201d\n\nShe chuckles.\n\n\u201cWho were them boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust some boys from school. They always pick on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust \u2018cause. They\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d you ask, scrunching your toes and noticing how dirty they\u2019ve gotten.\n\n\u201cJane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cBilly. We just moved here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, turning her gaze to the side, then back to you. \u201cMy house is on Hill Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that is. We just got here last night. We came in on the bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d she points over your shoulder, \u201con the edge of town. C\u2019mon.

I have to watch our stuff so Mom can find a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d After a pause, she asks \u201cWhat grade are you in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in Second this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too. Maybe we can sit together.\u201d\n\nThe very suggestion makes you feel queasy and uncomfortable. \u201cI better get back before she comes back,\u201d you say stepping past her.\n\n\u201cOkay. See ya later.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee ya later.\u201d\n\nYou cut between two houses following their shared ribbon driveway. As you get to the front, you peek down the street and see that the gang is gone.\n\nThe park is empty now with no one in sight. You cross the street and see that the bag is still right where it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nYou climb the cement picnic table and plop down on top of it with your feet on the bench.

It\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\n\nShe unrolls a paper bag and slams down a small boat of shriveled, dried up shrimp and a larger one half full of crispy fries (the small ones that no one wants and are generally tossed out instead of being served to customers).\n\nYou begin to pick at them one by one, but your hunger soon takes over and you start to cram them into your mouth by the handful.\n\n\u201cSlow down. They\u2019re all yours. I had mine already on the way back,\u201d she says in a more pleasant tone. \u201cI got a job today.

A small flower garden runs the length of the sidewalk connecting the kitchen door at the back of the house to the one on the side of the garage.
