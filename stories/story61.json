You sit up and scratch some fleas that have infested your body. You also realize its still daylight. You hate waking up early.\n\nYou lope into the bathroom and look in the mirror where you see a canine face covered in gray fur, you remember a time when your fur was completely brown.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting old Wolf\u201d you say to yourself like you always do while trying to look on the bright side that at least you don\u2019t have the mange. You think you\u2019d just put a silver bullet in your head if you ever started to go bald.\n\nAfter eating some left over mutton in the fridge and some Gummy Blobs (for the sugar \u201cpick me up\u201d) you ponder how you\u2019re going to pay this month\u2019s rent on your cabin. You call your agent Erik and see if that little pissant has found any work for you. Hopefully it\u2019s an actual job and not just a guest speaker spot at a comic convention.\n\n\u201cErik! It\u2019s me Wolf! Pick up the fucking phone! I know you\u2019re there!\u201d you say when you get the answering machine.\n\n\u201cErik! Get on the phone NOW, or I\u2019m gonna go over there and shove a pipe organ up your ass!\u201d\n\nThat got his attention.\n\n\u201cWolf, I\u2019m sorry, but I fear I\u2019m in a deep depression.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else is new? Look I need some work, got anything? I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s straight to video. I just need some of the green stuff!\u201d\n\u201cSadly, I don\u2019t think I do, but then I haven\u2019t really checked\u2026I\u2019m so depressed. I\u2019ve been wondering if I made the right decisions in my life\u2026and now it\u2019s too late for me to do anything about it, because I\u2019m old\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJoin the fucking club Erik! Look do you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut my art, my music, that is my love and its failing me again. My latest opera isn\u2019t doing well. I wonder if I chose the wrong thing to love and pursue. Just like I did with Christine. Oh Christine WHY couldn\u2019t you have loved me? I loved you\u2026\u201d\n\nWonderful, he\u2019s in full blown tortured artist mode. He can go on like this forever. You can either give up, or persist in getting something out of him.", "action_results": [{"action": "Persist", "result": "\u201cOh boo fucking hoo, your latest Opera hasn\u2019t been doing too well lately. At least people are paying to see the goddamn thing! As bad of a composer, and musician you are, you oughta be glad anyone\u2019s even paying to see the goddamn thing! People don\u2019t want to see anything with me in it! And at least you\u2019ve got another job to fall back on LIKE BEING AN AGENT THAT\u2019S SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING ME A FUCKING JOB!\u201d you snarl.\n\nThere\u2019s some dead air briefly and then Erik begins talking again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t be complaining about my problems to you. You of course know all about torment. A war that wages within you, a beast that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cErik I\u2019ve got no time and I\u2019m in no mood to hear how we\u2019re supposed to be kindred spirits, you just better tell me you found something for me and it better not be another guest speaker spot at a comic convention!\u201d\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see\u2026I dunno. Werewolves aren\u2019t popular anymore you know\u2026there might be something\u2026here it is! It\u2019s called Wolf Pack.\u201d\n\u201cPack? That implies more than one wolf on the set there Erik. Well I suppose I can share the spotlight with some others. As long as I\u2019m in charge of course.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEr\u2026well according to this, you\u2019d be the old cranky grandpa wolf that makes a bunch of rude remarks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! What kind of stupid shit is that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s the stuff.\u201d Erik replies not catching on.\n\u201cI mean what the hell kind of movie is this?\u201d\n\u201cIts uh\u2026let\u2019s see\u2026oh here. It\u2019s a horror comedy about a werewolf family and how they\nadjust to human society. Looks like you\u2019ll be playing with a lot of young pups as you\u2019d call them.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?! NO! What the fuck Erik? I\u2019m a fucking monster not something to be fucking laughed at! And they already did a movie like that a long time ago and it sucked!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s all I got. Maybe you could talk to the director to make changes since they also wrote it. I\u2019m sure you and her are familiar with each other. You had an affair with her for quite some time.\u201d\n\u201cUh, you wanna narrow that list down Erik?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mary. You know, the one who used to be married to Frankie, until your affair broke up both of your marriages?\u201d\n\nErik\u2019s new information didn\u2019t exactly make you any more enthusiastic to want to take the job.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take the job anyway", "result": "\u201cAlright I\u2019ll take the job, just tell me where its at.\u201d You say.\n\nAfter Erik gives you the information, you ride your Harley to the studio.\n\nWhen you arrive on the set, you see a bunch of snot nosed wolflings hanging around trying to look \u201ctough\u201d. Some of them are in human form, but you can smell them for who they truly are though. These cubs today, you swear they would\u2019ve never lasted back in the old days. All flash and nothing to back it up. (Though you don\u2019t mind looking at the young females that are there) That\u2019s why they hang out in packs. You never did that even when you were young. You were always a lone wolf.\n\n\u201cHey who\u2019s the fossil?\u201d one of them asks.\n\u201cHey Grandpa, the remake of Old Yellow is next door!\u201d\n\nThis causes a howl of laughter from all of them, until you confront the one who said it. Probably the leader no doubt. Not even in wolf form. Pathetic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you time to transform into a more adequate fighting form before I neuter you.\u201d You calmly explain.\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re like 300 years old! I could take\u2026\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t say you didn\u2019t give him a chance.\n\nYou immediately pounce on him, knocking him down while clamping your jaws on his face and digging your fangs in.\n\n\u201cHOLY SHIT DUDE!\u201d one of them shouts.\n\u201cOh my god he\u2019s killing him!\u201d a female screams.\n\u201cGet him off of him, get him off of him!\u201d\n\nWhile them all attempt to pull you off of their leader you hear a familiar voice that gets your attention.\n\n\u201cWell, I see Erik passed my script over to you, good. I\u2019m also glad to see you\u2019re still as anti-social as usual Wolf.\u201d Mary says as you finally get off of your misguided heckler and approach her. She still looks the same, though she looks a lot better now that she got rid of that hair style she used to have and dyed it blonde.\n\u201cJust re-establishing the proper hierarchy, nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, always the Alpha Male, that was what I always loved about you. So primal. Maybe later I can dress in a little red cloak and we can reenact a fairy tale.\u201d\n\u201cSome fairy tale, as I remember you loved a lot of beings.\u201d\n\u201cHey I can\u2019t help who I am. I was created this way.\u201d\n\u201cJust like Frankie eh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you compare me to that sicko! Yes we are controlled by our genetics to a certain degree, but as you damn well know I rose above them! I made my own identity. I\u2019m a successful director and writer now, so what if I have a healthy sexual appetite? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree given all the beings you had your way with before, after and DURING your marriage!\u201d\n\u201cLook never mind all that. I got a real problem with this film.\u201d You say side stepping her correct accusation.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Are you kidding me? It sucks! It makes a mockery of werewolves! You even named one of them fucking Benji!\u201d\n\u201cWell comedy is popular now. Plus children like monsters just as long as they aren\u2019t too scary, so I was hoping to make it a family film.\u201d\n\u201cARRGH! I don\u2019t DO family films! This is insulting and demeaning!\u201d\n\u201cHow? Come on Wolf. In most horror movies you\u2019ve made you always got killed in the end by a human, how was that any less demeaning?\u201d\n\u201cBecause at least I was portrayed as feared monster that killed a bunch of people! I can play ball with the humans and their idealistic notion of good always having to overcome evil and all that\u2026but THIS! This makes me into a fucking joke! I can\u2019t even believe you of all people wrote this\u2026no wait I can. You fucking undead don\u2019t have any consideration for anyone, but yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m technically not even undead, I\u2019m created from several dead bodies. I\u2019m more of a golem.\u201d Mary attempts to correct you.\n\u201cWho gives a shit, you\u2019re still basically a walking corpse, and your flesh is dead. You\u2019re Undead in my book.\u201d\n\u201cYou know for someone who hasn\u2019t been able to find a job in months and is basically just rotting away in his little cabin, you\u2019d think that you\u2019d be a little more appreciative.

Well that proves it. You think I\u2019m a joke because that\u2019s how you wrote the character.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI see your time with that bloodsucker was well spent. Learning how to exploit and leech right? Look maybe you can pull this shit with those puppies over there, but I ain\u2019t fucking one! I don\u2019t need the money that badly. I\u2019ll go fucking live my twilight years in the forest and DIE there as nature probably intended. I don\u2019t need this shit.\u201d\n\nAs you turn to leave, Mary shouts at you.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right go on leave Mr. Lone Wolf! You\u2019ll fucking die alone, you stubborn bastard! I tried to help you! Erik tried to help you and you don\u2019t appreciate any of it! That\u2019s why none of your children speak to you and\u2026\u201d\n\nYou run back over to her and slam her into the wall. You stare at her face to face as she struggles to get free. She\u2019s strong, but you manage to keep her pinned. She really pissed you off and you were already pissed off to begin with.\n\n\u201cFuck you, and fuck Erik! You two don\u2019t know shit about me, never did. I\u2019m through with the pair of you! In fact I think I\u2019ll be taking something with me since you\u2019re so worried about me being alone\u2026\u201d\n\nYou release Mary and go over to the wolflings who look a little worried that you\u2019re going to cause harm to them. Many of them cast their eyes downward.\n\n\u201cHey, you want to be REALLY tough? You want to really raise some hell? Come with me. If you want to stay under the thumb of this patchwork dead bitch and be exploited and mocked, stay here.\n\nYour statement alone convinces all of them. They all follow you, even the one you made an example of. Mary attempts to call everyone back, but it\u2019s useless, you\u2019ve taken control of the pack and they\u2019ll do what you want now.\n\nAnd right now you want to get into a fight. You think about all the people and creatures that wronged you in some way and only two of them keep coming to mind consistently.\n\nOne is that fucking Dr. Victor Frankenstein. If it wasn\u2019t for him, Frankie and Mary wouldn\u2019t have been created in the first place which also means you wouldn\u2019t have gotten yourself into trouble all those years ago. You wouldn\u2019t have had to put up with his \u201cchildren\u201d taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker. Fucking Dracula or Vlad, or whatever the hell he\u2019s calling himself these days.
