It feels as though someone's poured an entire vat of hot coffee over your entire body.  Somehow, you get the sense that you've been asleep a lot longer than normal. You open your eyes to find yourself laying in a patch of grass, staring up at a clear, starry sky, interrupted by the branches of nearby trees.  You don't move for a moment. How did you get outside? You don't remember going to sleep out here... as a matter of fact, you don't remember going to sleep at all. Or anything else, as a matter of fact.\n\n\nThe pain is fading fast, so you sit up and take a look around, pulse racing. The shadowy forms of trees surround you, the sounds of the night bombarding your senses.  It occurs to you that you're hyperventilating. Is this what it feels like to have a heart attack? No this is a panic attack of some kind. Instinctively, you find yourself focusing on a single blade of grass in the field.  With shaking hands, you pluck it from the dirt and study it, taking note of its shape, the feel of it in your hand, the nearly indistinguishable pattern of little veins running through it. Mindfulness. That's supposed to help with Panic attacks.  Somehow, you remember that. But you can't remember where you learned it.  \n\n\nSlowly but surely, your breathing normalizes.  You wipe the snot from your nose and the tears from your eyes as your body stops convulsing.  For the first time since you woke up, you notice the cool night breeze. You're going to be fine.  If you just keep your wits, you'll find a way out of this eventually. You take a quick inventory of everything you can remember.  Random bits of knowledge surface in your head, facts about whales, mathematical formulas, the steps to changing a tire. But no memories of the people, or events, or books that taught you those things.\n\n\nAs you contemplate these things, you notice a few items laying in the grass around you.  Namely, a small backpack and an odd metal disk, with a glowing screen on one side. You pick up the disk first and examine it.  \"Insufficient power,\" flashes across its face over and over in red.  Something about it tugs at something in your memory, but you can't quite put your finger on what.  Confused, you slip it into your pocket and turn to the bag. You unzip it to find a lighter, a knife, a sleeping bag, a pillow, and... a whole mountain of Cheez-Its and Mountain Dew?  Just what kind of person are you? Still, it's better than nothing, so you slip it over your shoulders.\n\n\nAs you try (and fail), to take your bearings from the waning crescent moon, (not that it really matters, it's not like you know where you came from), you become aware of a strange noise in the distance.  You stop and listen. Is that yelling? Wait, yelling is a human noise, right? So, where there's yelling, there's humans. Before you can even finish processing that thought, your feet are carrying you towards the source of the noise.  You didn't know you could run this fast on pavement, much less over the uneven turf of the forest, but then, maybe you're a famous football player or something and just don't remember it.  \n\n\nThe yelling grows louder as you draw nearer.  A dim light shines in the distance, growing brighter.  You slow down a little, these shouts don't sound like happy ones.\n\n\n\"Stop struggling or it'll only hurt more!\" a gravelly voice says.\n\n\n\"Help! Stop! Let me go!\"  An extremely high pitched voice this time.\n\n\nYou've slowed to a tip-toe now.  Whatever this is, you're not sure you want to be a part of it.  Still you creep closer until you can just make out the figures involved between the trees.  They look small from here, no bigger than children, but then, it's a little hard to tell from this distance.  It looks like they might be wearing some kind of cloaks, green ones, if your eyes don't deceive you.  \n\n\n\"Gag her before she draws someone to us!\"  Says the gravel tongued shadow to two others holding down a third, \"Get her in the bag and tie it tight.  The last thing we need is another escape.\"\n\n\nYour palms are soaked with sweat.  You should do something, anything, to help, but whoever these people are, they certainly don't sound like the kind of folks you'd like to mess with...", "action_results": [{"action": "Creep closer and attack", "result": "You drop into a crouch and creep closer, stopping behind trees whenever you can.   Now that you're closer, you can make out more details, and boy are these people weird.  They're even shorter up close, they'd probably only come up to your waist.  But that's the least strange thing about them.  They're skin resembles Paper-Mache, all folded over itself.  And then there's the ears, so long and pointy.  Almost as big as they are, and yet still they point straight up.  Forget whatever you thought about only humans yelling.  You must've forgotten that too, because these things are no humans.\n\n\nThe two biggest creatures hold down a smaller one, (perhaps that one is only a child), while the one that appears to be the leader stands and watches.  Like you thought, all but the one on the ground are clad in green cloaks, reaching nearly to their feet, with a strange symbol of something like a broken goblet embroidered on their backs in brown.  \n\n\nThey've nearly got the child into a big sack now, but she (he? It?) still hasn't given up.  \n\n\n\"Please!\"  She cries, \"I just wanna go home!  Let me go home!\"\n\n\n\"We're giving you a new home.\"  Says the leader, \"A better home!  Don't you want to help make your old home better?\"\n\n\n\"No!  I want my papa!\"\n\n\nJust watching this makes you nauseous.  This has got to be stopped, there's no way you can sit by and let it happen.  Before you've even so much as thought of a plan, you're on your feet, charging the creatures with...", "action_results": [{"action": "the knife!", "result": "You flick your knife open and tense for battle.  It feels so small in your hand, so weak.  If only you had a gun, or a hatchet at least.  Still, it's better than using your fists. \n\n\nBefore you have the chance lose your nerve, you charge one of the creatures holding down the... other creature.  (You're really not sure what to call any of these things, you've never seen anything quite like them before).  You slam into it, knocking it to the ground before it has a chance to react.  It's eyes go wide as you plunge the knife into it's stomach, (or what appears to be it's stomach).  It penetrates easier than you expected, the knife.  Feels a little too easy.\n\n\nBut before you have time to fully contemplate the moral ambiguity of your actions, you see, out of the corner of your eye, the other creature charging you with some kind of sharpened stick.  You act faster than you ever thought you could, rolling to the side, just as it brings it's stick down in a stabbing motion.  The stick buries itself into the chest of the first creature, (the one with the knife still stuck in it's chest).  If it wasn't dead before, it certainly is now.\n\n\nThe creature with the stick stares at it's fallen friend, stunned.  You should strike now, while it's distracted, but all you can do is stare at the dead creature.  You did that.  Even though it's not exactly a human, something about the whole thing just feels wrong.  Slowly, the surviving creature turns towards you.\n\n\n\"Why would you do that?\"  He asks,  \"That was my friend!\"\n\n\n\"You were attacking that... other creature!\"  You say.  Even as you say it, the words feel hollow.  \"He... had it coming!\"\n\n\n\"You have no idea what you've gotten yourself involved in!\"  He says, \"You're messing with things you shouldn't you crazy monster!\"  With that, the creature charges you once more, wrenching it's weapon from the chest of its dead friend.  Perhaps you should let him strike you down.  Maybe you're the monster here.  But then, what about that other creature?  The one he was tormenting?  What does that make him?  No, you were just acting as any good person should when they see someone in danger. Just as the creature reaches you, instinct takes over and you slam your fist into it's head.  \n\n\nThese creatures don't just look like Paper-Mache, they tear like it too.  As soon as your hand makes contact, his face crumples inward and he staggers back, falling to the ground, dead.  You stare at your hand, stunned.  Either you've got some sort of hidden superpowers, or these creatures are weaker than most.  That doesn't seem normal.  Even with your broken memory, you can be pretty sure of that.\n\n\nAs the adrenaline wears off, you remember that there were three creatures involved.  Two doing the heavy lifting and one giving orders.  You take a quick look around you, but see nothing.  It must've run off somewhere; the only other living thing left in the area is the creature you came to save in the first place.  ", "action_results": [null]}, null]}, null]}]}
