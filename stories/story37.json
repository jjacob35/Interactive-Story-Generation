He was tall, his silver white hair as long as his shoulders. His leather clothes were as black as the darkest night, and though he carried no visible weapon, it was clear that he was powerful in the darkest of Magics. Around his waist hung an empty sheath.\n\n\nHe climbed the tower's stairs, finding nothing but dust due to months of neglect. The figure listened for the sound of any traps, and though he heard none, he wasn't willing to take the risk. Summoning a simple shield about him, he found the climbing shaft, and began the final stretch upwards.\n\n\nMonths ago, he had heard rumour of a Sword of Power that had once shared in the Magical energy of the Sword of Light, even if it had been so brief. If the Demon King's desire to allow the Darkness of the Void inside Anaria was to be fulfilled, then this Sword of Power, if it existed, had to be retreived. \n\n\nThe figure exited the climbing shaft and entered into the laboratory of the late Warlock, Redinor. Searching the spacious room, he found nothing in the darkness but the bones of a right arm and the ashes of Redinor himself. \n\n\n\"Come to me,\" the figure said in an enchanting voice. \n\n\nThe sound of metal gently skating across stone and taking to the air reached his ears, and just before the blade tip struck his heart, the figure caught it by the hilt.\n\n\nGripping it with both hands, the figure told his name to the Sword of Power: Adwar, the Demon Necromancer. The blade glowed with black energy, a malicious force touching Adwar's mind.\n\n\n\"I think... that we are going to have quite a lot of fun together, you and I,\" Adwar said gently, a malevolent grin upon his face. Lightening struck outside the tower, and the Demon Necromancer sheathed the evil blade. With a flash, he and the black disappeared from the tower.\n\n\n\"Doe Ragni Horu Stridyee,\" Adwar said into the night sky.\n\n\nA black shadow emerged before him, silhoutted only by a gray light. \n\n\nAdwar drew the Sword of Shadows out and placed the tip against the shadow's chest. With a shriek, the shadow was absorbed into the black sword. A smile spread across Adwar's face, knowing that he had succeeded. Redinor had ignored one thing in forging the Sword of Shadows: summoning the spirit of the first Witch Queen and fusing it with the blade.\n\n\n\"With this very blade, I will bring destroy the Riders of the Elvish Empire, and the nation which they protect,\" the Demon Necromancer whispered into the night. \"With them out of the way, I will be able to let the Darkness of the Void inside Anaria.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Chapter 1", "result": "The Imperial Palace, the Elvish Empire\n\n\nIt's another day of training for you. Your Phoenix, Rezaick, is underneath you, and for once, everything is actually going well.

Thankfully, a team of Dwarves had crafted a mechanical one for you soon afterwards. It doesn't bother you anymore, though. The good thing is that, as far as anyone knows, no one has entered Redinor's tower and retrieved the evil Sword of Power known as the Sword of Shadows.\n\n\n\"Draw your sword! I'm sending Naric up to spar with you!\" your father yells.\n\n\nSwitching the reins to your left hand, you draw the Sword of Light out, just as you hear your brother's dragon, Silver Fang climb into the air with her massive wings. In your brother's hand is the Sword of the Sky, the blade given to every Dragon Rider.\n\n\nRezaick twitches uncomfortably, and you can understand why.

You fly through the air and plant your foot firmly against Naric's chest, then push away. Your brother is knocked from his own saddle and begins to fall.\n\n\n\"Time for a little Magic,\" you think.

Your wife is surrounded by scrolls and books, her hand scribbling furiously in a journal. Aercaena's head snaps up to face you when the doors slam shut.

You turn to see him walking briskly towards you. \"I have information from a reliable source that the one who launched the attack upon the Eastern Docks was a Demon Necromancer who called himself Adwar. We don't know where he is, but we know where he came from. According to my source, Adwar attacked from the southeast. It is most likely that he will attack the Western Docks and attempt to take control of them, leaving us and the Dragon Race divided from one another, and giving the Demons of Synorack a perfect opportunity to attack the Western Kingdoms. If they do, they will be able to wipe us and the Fairy Kingdom out easily. If that happens, then they will gain access to the Gates of Restraint, and will be able to allow the Darkness of the Void to enter into Anaria once again.\n\n\n\"I'm sending you, Aric,\" King Vorinar says, \"To prevent Adwar from making his goals a reality.

Dwarves and Fairies do not usually cope well with each other, but they will make exceptions; I hope that they will make this one of them.

Is that what you really want?\"\n\n\n\"Anaria can descend into Darkness for all I care,\" Adwar says, sneering at you as he stands. \"Down with the Fairies, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Race of Men, the Dragons, the Phoenixes! They can all die for all I care! Down with the pinacles of Light, up with the black banners of the Forsaken Races of the Demons of Synorack and the Black Witches of Sibia! Let the Gates of Restraint be broken open, let the Darkness of the Void into Anaria once again and forevermore!

Each stroke you block, every stab you avoid. Ducking as he swipes at your head, you turn your arm blade into a miniature battering ram, and slam its conical point against his chest. You can feel ribs breaking under it, but you don't care. You just want to end him forever. You just want to rid the world of him.\n\n\nAdwar cries out in pain, clutching at his chest. Turning your battering ram back into an arm blade, you repel another attack and roll to the side. You can feel the adrenaline rushing through you so strongly, you feel as if you have no limits.\n\n\nAs Adwar's heel hit his chest, Naric felt the wind being knocked from his lungs. As he fell over the edge, he struggled to breathe; he felt as if he was drowning. But before he fell to his death, Naric took the Sword of the Sky and plunged its point into the tower. Pain jolted through his arm as he suddenly stopped, simply hanging in the air.\n\n\nLooking up, Naric saw that he was below the clouds now, and then he heard another clang from above. It was as if an orchestra had played its final piece, the last few notes of a heroic epic. Something fell through the clouds, and, narrowing his eyes, Naric saw that it was the Sword of Light.\n\n\nCalling upon the air around the Sword of Power, Naric caused the blade to be drawn to him. Instead of touching the earth, it flew to his outstretched hand, bruising his fingers as its steel hilt violently slammed against them. Turning the blade so that it faced the tower, Naric used the paired Swords of Power to begin the long and exhausting climb back to the top.\n\n\nYou stab at Adwar's chest, penetrating the shadows surrounding him. You feel skin being torn as the point of your arm blade plunges in, then pluck it back out. Amazingly, Adwar has the endurance to press on, ignoring the wounds that you inflict upon him. Then, you stumble on a stray fragment of stone, and fall backwards.\n\n\nAdwar takes the opportunity to plunge his arm blade into your stomach, carving through the Dwarf Steel as if it were butter. Yanking it back out, he falls back, exhausted by his efforts. But then, he rises to his feet, determined to finish the job before he dies.\n\n\nRolling over, you barely avoid his arm blade swinging down. Clutching the wound in your midriff, you rise to your feet, refusing to allow the abomination before you win. Then, you hear a shout, and turn to see Naric standing there. In his right hand is the Sword of Light, which he tosses to you, telling you to finish Adwar once and for all before he collapses to his knees.\n\n\nYour arm blade transforms back into a mechanical hand once more, catching the Sword of Light just before Adwar attacks. Your blades ring as they collide, and then you kick him back. Swinging your sword, you cleave Adwar's left arm from his body, feeling no pity as he screams in agony. Then, a shaft of pain pierces your stomach, and looking down, you see blood flowing out from your wound. The damaged steel allows you to see that the skin surrounding it is webbed with black veins.

Just looking at the mangled mess makes you feel even more sick. \n\n\n\"There's no use,\" Adwar rasps, giving a weak laugh. \"I'm already dead, and so is your brother. The Sword of Light and the Sword of Shadows have fallen. You've already lost. The Demons and Black Witches will overrun your lands. You'll never be safe.\"\n\n\nNaric notices your wound and turns back to Adwar, shouting, \"What did you do to him, you slimy bastard?! What did you do to Aric?!\"\n\n\n\"Dragon venom,\" Adwar says, his voice growing more and more faint by the second. \"No point in hiding it. Not even your precious Living Fire can heal him. Outside of the help of the Creator, the only cure is the Elixir of Life, and that can be brewed only once every 50 years; besides, only one knows how to make it anymore, and from what I've heard, he's almost out. Your brother will be dead within the month. And you won't be able to bring him back to life because his soul will have been destroyed.\"\n\n\nWith his final breath, Adwar gives one last laugh, and then the light fades from his eyes, leaving two blank, gray moonstones.

After strapping you into Rezaick's saddle, Naric climbs onto Silver-Fang, and you take flight. As soon as Silver-Fang's bulky figure leaves the tower, it bursts asunder, destroying what ever was inside.\n\n\nAfter some time, you look over the side, and see an army of Demons in complete disarray as they're slaughtered by the Elvish Army. You smile to yourself, glad that you delayed Adwar long enough that the Demon Necromancer was unable to invade the Western Docks; with luck, the Elvish Empire will have taken back the Eastern Docks.\n\n\nBut then your smile promptly turns to a frown. You remember King Vorinar telling you to not only kill Adwar, but to also bring the Sword of Shadows back so that Kerinettory could unmake it. Instead, you had disarmed Adwar and sent the Sword of Shadows flying into the Eastern Ocean. Fate was not with you today, and you know in your heart that, if you survive, must fight it again, no matter who wields the cursed Sword of Power.\n\n\nThen, you begin to lose consciousness, but you know that you're not dying; you're merely being contacted by a being of great power.\n\n\nYou find yourself in a dark void, not the Void which the Gates of Restraint block, but one that is light with shining stars of every color. Sitting before you upon a shining throne of Light, you see a man crowned with silver, dressed in the finest steel armour. At his side hangs a long sword with a single red gem set into its silver hilt; just by looking at it, you know that this blade is the greatest Sword of Power that was ever created. Only the Creator himself would be able to even wear such a weapon on his belt, much less wield it.\n\n\nBut it isn't his gear or weapons to which you are drawn to, but much more his features and face. Though scarred, it is still youthful, even though it has been many millennia since he created Anaria. His ears are pointed, like those of the Elves, the Race which he holds most dear. He reminds you of the first and greatest of the Elvish Kings, King Nornien.\n\n\nYou bow before him, paying the Creator the respect that he earned when he created your world.\n\n\n\"Rise,\" the Creator says, standing from his throne. \"I did not bring you here, Aric Lightson, to grovel at my feet. I brought you here to tell you of some of the things that will come to pass, and to thank you.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "\"Thank me?\" you ask, surprised. \"Thank me for what?\"\n\n\n\"You have done a great service to me by defeating the traitorous Elf Adwar, who called himself the Demon Necromancer,\" the Creator says, smiling. \"I do not say this lightly. You defeated one who sought to destroy everything that I'd built, but things will become worse still for the Seven Holy Races. You have many troubles ahead of you, son of Light.\n\n\n\"Adwar stabbed you with an arm blade coated in dragon venom,\" the Creator continues. \"Without my help, you will die. Which is why I have brought you before me. If I heal you- and this cannot be undone; you will remain immune to all poisons and sickness for the rest of your days, but not enchantment- do you promise to continue to serve Light and all that is good?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" you say. You're eager to finally be freed of the poison that plagues your body. Even now, you are weakening. You can feel the life draining away.\n\n\n\"Good,\" says the Creator, and, striding towards you, he taps your head gently. Instantly you feel the pain leave, and life begins to return to you. \"Go now, Aric, and fulfill your promise to me. If you do well, I will make you and your wife honored members of my court upon your deaths.\"\n\n\n\"You mean that this isn't your court?\" you ask, confused.\n\n\nThe Creator laughs, then says, \"Wouldn't you think that my court would have the spirits of the heroes of ages long passed, rather than sit here all by my lonesome? Wouldn't you think that I have a kingdom, where I am ruler of all alongside a queen? Aric, I may rule Anaria, but it is only a small fraction of the worlds I hold. Your world is not the only one that I created. Hopefully, with the help of the Race of Men, you will reach beyond the stars and meet the inhabitants of those worlds.\"\n\n\nThe connection breaks, and you find yourself to be asleep, still sitting in Rezaick's saddle.

You find a long corridor outside the door.\n\n\n\"Please don't follow me,\" you say as you back down the hall, ready to run if you have to. Feeling for the Sword of Light at your belt, you realize that it isn't there, and this simple fact causes your uneasy feelings to turn towards fear.\n\n\nAll but one of the women stay, though the others look at you eagerly as they pile up at the door.

You can't treat me like this! Who are you people, and why am I here?!\"\n\n\n\"But to become my husband, of course, silly,\" says a seductive voice behind you. You whirl around to find a young maiden clothed only in her undergarments, though those hardly cover her at all; it seems as if a thin thread is all that is keeping her bra to her chest. \"Don't you remember me?\"\n\n\nThinking back, you remember the maiden that you'd saved from bandits while on your quest to retrieve the Sword of Light from Redinor.\n\n\n\"Y-you're that girl!\" you exclaim, spluttering with disbelief. \"What are you d-doing here? Where are we?\"\n\n\n\"Didn't you get the message when I kissed you at our departure?\" she asks playfully, twisting her hair and giving a small girlish giggle. \"I was telling you that I liked you.\"\n\n\n\"That's nice and all, but I'm already married,\" you explain to her, fidgeting with your hands.\n\n\nShe begins to advance, her breasts shaking gently as she puts one foot in front of the other.

Backing up further, you bump into something, and find the massive, circular pink bed against your back.\n\n\nYou turn to face the maiden again, and now, she's standing right in front of you, a melancholy look on her face. \n\n\n\"We recieved word that the Elvish Empire was destroyed last night,\" she says sadly. \"You fell into the Western Ocean, and I rescued you.

She begins to take off your boots, and then smiles at you, licking her red lips with anticipation.\n\n\n\"I don't even know your name!\" you say, silently begging that the Elvish Empire hasn't fallen. Even so, you begin to believe the maiden, even though you don't want to.\n\n\n\"Calypso,\" she says simply.
