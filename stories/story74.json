A grunt and a thud, in the trench in front of you one falls, reaching his hand out to you.  Crawling over to him you rip off his armor, trying to stop the bleeding.  Almost impossible with the arrow lodged in his chest, ripping it out would only kill him faster.\n\n\nYou sit there cradling him, trying to offer some small comfort in his final moments.  He tries to speak, but only a gurgling sound emerges as crimson red trickles out of the side of his mouth.  One final sigh and his whole body relaxes, his head falls back.  His glassy eyes stare at you, only seeing emptiness.\n\n\nPlacing him down, you continue to trudge through the mud.  Around you more have fallen, and will continue to fall.  A dark purple blast of energy flies overhead, frying some unfortunate.\n\n\nYou make a run for the trees.  Never running in a straight line, you start right, then dart left as you dive behind a tree.  A few arrows lodge themselves in the ground beside you. \n\n\nDamn elves.\n\n\nYou think back to how the elves had first come peacefully.  Offering promises of power and strength.  The orcs didn't want anything to do with them and their magic.  The next time the elves showed up; however, it was in force.  Looking to capture conscripts for their fight against the Empire.  The orcs wanted nothing to do with their war, but since the elves brought it to our doorstep, we had now come to retaliate. \n\n\nThe elves, unable to fight a war on two fronts, were sure to crumble. \n\n\nBut this all started four years ago.  Turns out elves have incredible resolve... which you intended to break.", "action_results": [{"action": "Advance", "result": "Only a few miles ahead, you see the castle stronghold of the Wister Elves' king.  King Harribor, intent on delaying his final stand, hides behind his people.\n\n\nCoward. \n\n\nHe would let his enemies lay waste to his nation, rather than meeting his fate out on the battlefield.\n\n\nBy now, you've made your way to a ridge, behind which many orcs wait.  Across is another ridge, with orcs similarly stationed.  In between, dozens and dozens of orcs slowly advance: hiding in trenches, behind rocks, and amidst piles of dead comrades.  They will never make it through unless you buy them time. \n\n\nAhead, the elves had constructed wooden walls and towers.  Each had slits and ramparts to shoot their arrows and blast their magic. \n\n\nScanning the area, you see that the elve's defenses are strongest on their right flank. Perfect.  All you need to do is charge down the ridge and straight towards that tower. \n\n\nYou grab an orc by the shoulder, he looks back grunting.\n\n\n\"See how strong their defenses are on the right?\"\n\n\nHe peers out, grunting in acknowledgment.\n\n\n\"I need you all to string up, focus all of your fire in that region.\"\n\n\n\"Why? Their left is weakest.\"\n\n\n\"I know, I'm going to use that to our advantage.\"\n\n\nYou're about to leave when you pat his shoulder again.\n\n\n\"Try not to shoot me.\"\n\n\nYou backtrack down into the forest and see some lights coming from the trees.  The elves are watching their line closely.\n\n\nSeeing multiple orcs in the darkness, you stop them.  They look at you inquisitively until you explain your plan.  They are eager to follow.\n\n\nYou move back behind the ridge, close to the front lines, careful to stay in the darkness.  Peering over the top you notice something new: a system of hidden trenches filled with elves.  They must be expecting the orcs to charge at any minute and are planning a surprise in the trenches.\n\n\nYou inspect the trench immediately below you.  It leads directly to the door of a tower.  You see an officer using a dimly glowing spyglass.  Near him, and scattered throughout the trenches, are wounded elves.  Some fit to fight, some are not, and yet they'll do it regardless.  You have to respect that at least.\n\n\nYou ready your bow, and sight an elf slumped against the trench wall.  Bloody bandages wrapped around his head, he holds his dagger and appears to be praying.  He looks almost like a child, several years younger than yourself. \n\n\nAs you let loose, the rest do as well.  The elf gasps in surprise as the arrow pierces his chest.  You all fire several arrows, until each elf in front of you is pin-cushioned.\n\n\nNo one is walking away from this.  No one sounds an alarm.\n\n\nMaking your way through the trench to the nearest battlement, you ready your axe, short enough to be used with one hand but long enough for two.  You stand next to the tower door, inhaling deeply.", "action_results": [null]}]}
