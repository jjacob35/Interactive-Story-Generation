You were sharper than most of your classmates, and thus began to find the lectures boring, often huddling alone in your study with an ancient tome borrowed from the library with the librarian's grudging permission, learning on your own faster than your teachers could hope to achieve.\n\nFinally, the master magicians admitted defeat. They no longer could teach you anything, and thus it came as a relief to them, that you were chosen, with two other magicians, to fortify the guard of an Alzuran emissary on the dangerous, bandit-infested road to Khofte, a coastal city in the far south.\n\nThe council of magicians apparently thought that a bit of adventure would help to dull your restlessness and sharpen your practical skills.\n\n\nTo begin with, you must choose to specialize in one of the five elements: Fire, Air, Water, Ice and Earth.\nYou may still manipulate the other four, but you can only hope to access the powerful effects with the element of your specialization.\nFurthermore, specializing in one element also slightly affects your character. Ice elementalists are known for the cool and logical mind, while Earth magicians tend to be protective of their charges.\n\nChoose your Specialization.", "action_results": [{"action": "I choose to specialize in Fire, the element of Passion, Heat and Destruction.", "result": "You quickly, and with passion, learned everything you can from your chosen element, regarding little else.\n\nYou especially have disregarded the lessons of Water and of Ice, having nothing but contempt for those who have to think through every situation when, obviously, there is need for speed.\n\nYou possess a greater physical prowess than most of your classmates, and since your inborn arrogance left your without many friends but quite some enemies, you had to use your quickness and strength to avoid being the target of constant ridicule - noone dared to ridicule you after a while.\nInstead, you became something of a loner. You simply know you are a better magician than the others, and you are willing to prove it.\n\nThe specialization of Fire enables you to aquire a deadly arsenal of combat spells, far superior to that of other magicians. You are also able to command the element of elements, the Flames themselves, to do your bidding. Also, you are somewhat resistant to their heat.\n\n\nMake a note somewhere that you have specialized in Fire.", "action_results": [{"action": "I am ready to begin my journey!", "result": "It is early summer in the world of Thyr, and the smell of spring has not yet left the air.\n\nThe emmissary's trek consists of two coaches, one for the magicians, of which there are two more on board, and one for the emissary and his bodyguard himself. Furthermore, there are two dozens warriors on horse accompanying the trek, some of which are scouting ahead.\n\nIt has been two days since you left the Academy of Alzur, and by now you have left the city's military influence, as can be witnessed by the steady growing worse of the road.\n\nYou know close to nothing about Fahan Brownhand's - the emissary of Alzur - orders, or about the man himself, save that he is known to be a devious mind and a quick judge of character, abilities well received within a politician.\n\nAlso you know that your trek is carrying valuable gifts in jewels and gold for Khalar, the citystate you are destined to reach within the week.\n\nYour two magician-companions are no strangers to you. Opposite of you is sitting J'Arel Whitefang, a young man emitting an aura of arrogance that is barely to bear in the confines of the coach. He is, as you know, a capable Fire elementalist.\n\nCurrently on top of the coach, unable to bear the presence of J'Arel any longer, is Lucius Tarchild, an Air mage of some renown. Unfortunately, Lucius is somewhat senior to you, and thus he has the right of first choice, as he explained to you with a wink.\nAlready weary by the long trip so far, you did not argue.", "action_results": [{"action": "I wish to pass the time and speak with J'Arel.", "result": "J'Arel looks up from some thought in surprise, as you cough to catch his attention. His cruel eyes narrow themselves, and he pierces you with his look.\n\n\"What is it that you want?\"", "action_results": [null, null, null]}, null, null]}]}]}
