You have never even met them before the hand of fate swept them away from you. All you know is that they died on October the 10th, the day the monstrous creature struck your village.\n\n\nYou remember growing up in an orphanage. Neither the adults nor the children there cared for you. Everyone avoided you for some reason. Even then, you felt like there is something you can do to change their opinion, until today. For today is the day that they've unanimously decided to kick you out.\n\n\nYou stumble into the street as the door shuts behind you. The thunder in the sky cackles as though they are laughing at you. The rain pours down your body as you lurch around the street, trying to find a shelter somewhere where you can stay.

There are also techniques that will require charm to use, and other techniques that rely on charm; such as that the more charm you have, the more your damage your technique will do.\n\n\n- You can choose to spend your childhood in the woods, training on your physical attributes. If you choose this path, you will gain immense strength and dexterity. Strength and dexterity determines how much damage you do to your opponents. While strength reflects how much health you have, and the maximum amount of damage you can dish out, dexterity determines the minimum.\n\n\n- You can choose to spend your childhood in the library, reading away your days. If you choose this path, you will gain immense intelligence. Intelligence determines how many chakra you have, and how much damage your chakra base attacks will do. You will need this for almost every techniques you come across. You will lose the game if your chakra hits zero.\n\n\n- You can choose to spend your childhood hiding from people in the daylight, and coming back out at night time to do various night activities, such as stealing, and spying on people. If you choose this path, you will gain immense stealth. Stealth is required for certain missions you will do, such as that you won't be able to do certain missions until your stealth is are the required level. There are also techniques that will require stealth to use, and other techniques that rely on stealth; such as that the more stealth you have, the more your damage your technique will do.
