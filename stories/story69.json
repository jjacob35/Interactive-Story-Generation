It\u2019s the middle of winter and you both are assigned to guard duty. Normally, the cold isn\u2019t an issue. However, due to increasing demon sightings, a few unlucky bastards have to spend the night outside the city walls keeping watch.\n\n\nSnow begins to fall, and your cheap leather armor offers little resistance.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, I quit.\u201d\n\n\nLars tosses down his sword and walks towards the city entrance.\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the demons?\u201d you ask.\n\n\nHe turns to you and a slight grin appears on his face.\n\n\n\u201cDemons? I welcome them with open arms. The city could use some heating up.\u201d\n\n\nWith that, he leaves. It\u2019s just you and the dead silence of the night. You try to stand still and focus on the dirt road leading away from the city. This road is where nearby demon sightings have occurred. A few minutes past and you swear you saw a red flash. Your hands shake and your heart beat slows down. Is your mind just playing tricks on you? Surely you\u2019re just reacting to the cold, right?\n\n\nMere moments after this thought you hear a laugh. Unlike what you were expecting, this isn\u2019t the laugh of some badass demon. No, it\u2019s the laugh of a female. You try to tighten your grip on your sword but can\u2019t move your fingers. Shit, maybe Lars had the right idea. Spending the night out here is a death sentence, regardless if demons attack.\n\n\nYou can\u2019t bear to stand any longer and lower yourself to the ground. You drop your sword and curl into a ball. You don\u2019t have the energy to move a muscle and your body becomes stiff. Your eyes shut close and you\u2019re out cold seconds later.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a strong soldier like you doing out here all alone?\u201d a soothing voice inquires.\n\n\nYou open your eyes to find yourself staring at barely clothed succubus. She radiates an intense heat, although it\u2019s not enough to burn.\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you ask.\n\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Catia and you never answered my question. Why are you all alone?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy other guard, Lars, left. Look there\u2019s his sword right there,\u201d you say, feeling compelled to give more information than necessary.\n\n\nCatia walks towards his sword and picks it up.\n\n\n\u201cIs this supposed to kill me? Ha! Don\u2019t make me laugh. Why is your equipment so poor?\u201d\n\n\nYou see no logical reason to tell a demon this but find yourself doing so instinctively.\n\n\n\u201cEver since demons came near our city, trade has been impossible. We have no experience with a threat this large and thus don\u2019t have the weapons or equipment to deal with it.\u201d\n\n\nShe grins and salivates to your every word. You take a moment to stare at her figure. She looks more human than succubi are told to be. Still, there are a few stark differences. These being her bright red eyes, dark red curled horns, and pink tail. Oh, and she utterly beautiful. More so than any human you\u2019ve seen. Despite being face to face demon for the first in your life, you feel entirely calm. Dare you say, the calmest you\u2019ve ever felt.\n\n\nThis calmness is ripped away when she begins to leave.\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm? You want me stay huh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 I do.\u201d\n\n\nShe grins again and starts chewing on her tail in a seductive manner.\n\n\n\u201cSorry, no can do. But if you want, I would love to see you again. Trust me, it will be the most pleasurable experience of your life. All you have to do for me is one small favor.\u201d\n\n\nYou feel an intense compulsion to comply with her every demand, but you stop yourself. Making deals with demons is serious business. You have enough willpower to at least ask what the favor is.\n\n\nShe explains how if you want to meet again you need to be a more suggestive state, like you are right now due to the cold. She recommends going to a bar and drinking for a few hours. Then, all you have to do is whisper her name and she will come visit, provided that you\u2019re alone.\n\n\nShe walks away leaving you all alone. As if in a trance, you make your way to The Drunk Tortoise Tavern.", "action_results": [{"action": "A few hours later...", "result": "\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m saying this Greg, immortality is not worth cutting off your cock. What\u2019s the point of being immortal if you\u2019re deprived of the best feeling in the world?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEy\u2019 maybe he\u2019s lacking in that area. No wonder he wants immortality if all he has to do his cut off an inch or two worth of pecker.\u201d\n\n\nGreg suddenly stands up, drawing your eyes to the bickering trio. They\u2019ve been arguing random hypotheticals since you\u2019ve gotten here. All you wanted was to get a quiet drink before meeting with Catia. As long as these buffoons are here, that\u2019s impossible.\n\n\nEven as Greg stands up he\u2019s shorter than the other two sitting. It\u2019s no wonder they pick on him, he looks pathetic.\n\n\n\u201cCan you both just shut the fuck up? I mean, god damn. All I\u2019m saying is living forever outweighs the downsides of not having a dick,\u201d he says in a whiny voice.\n\n\nThe other two laugh uncontrollably at his pitiful attempt of defiance. One manages to calm down and spits out,\n\n\n\u201cMaybe when it\u2019s smaller than a gnome\u2019s toothbrush, but for the rest us it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d\n\n\nQueue more uncontrollable laughter as Greg\u2019s face becomes redder than demon blood.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll shove a gnome\u2019s toothbrush up your ass if you say that one more time! C\u2019mon, let\u2019s move on to another question.\u201d\n\n\nThe trio quiets down and you zone them out. You take a swig of whisky and start to remember the reason while you\u2019re here. Oh yeah, the succubus. She wanted you to drink a bit before meeting her. You didn\u2019t necessarily jump at the idea of getting drunk before meeting with a demon, but she promised you she would make it worthwhile. You\u2019re pretty sure that means\u2026\n\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted by the thickheaded trio once again.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019d prefer your child be retarded and kind than ingenious and mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes Connor, I would.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod damn it, Greg! You want to spend an eternity with no dick while taking care of a retarded child? Pathetic. I would kill myself after a week.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHar har har! I would kill myself in a week if I had to live Greg\u2019s life as it is. No, scratch that, a day!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck you Tom. I can\u2019t be the only one who thinks this\u2026\u201d\n\n\nGreg glances around nervously looking for a savior. Eventually he turns his gaze towards you and his eyes light up.\n\n\n\u201cHey you over there! What would you rather have, a dumb, but kind child; or a smart, but cruel child?\u201d he says while pointing at you.\n\n\nYou stare blankly ahead and breathe a deep sigh. This is beyond stupid. You briefly consider just ignoring him and getting the hell out of this place.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you think that man would agree with you? He\u2019s a soldier. Surely, he recognizes the benefits a genius could provide for society. Especially when you consider the need for mages regarding the growing demon problem.\u201d\n\n\nSoldier? Shit you forgot to change out of your uniform. So much for staying inconspicuous. You can thank your lucky stars none of the other guards are here to see you in this shithole.\n\n\n\u201cNow now, let the man speak. Just because he\u2019s a soldier doesn\u2019t mean he agrees with you,\u201d says Tom.\n\n\n\u201cFine, what do you think...and hurry up! We don\u2019t have all day.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "\u201cI prefer a retarded but kind child.\"", "result": "\u201cThank you,\u201d Greg whispers.\n\n\n\u201cYou what!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPfft! And to think, I used to respect soldiers.\u201d\n\n\nTom and Connor start shouting about how much of a dumbass you are. You don\u2019t bother to engage with such idiotic banter. Instead, you walk out of the tavern without a second glance. As you make your way outside you are hit with a rush of cool air.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet Catia,\u201d you mutter to yourself.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Catia?\u201d\n\n\nYou turn around and only see the entrance to the tavern.\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cErmm down here sir!\u201d\n\n\nYou glance down and instantly recoil. It\u2019s Greg, what\u2019s he doing here?\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d\n\n\nHe begins to squirm uncomfortably and hyperventilate.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I\u2026erm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpit it out!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to thank you for agreeing with me,\u201d he says between irregular gasps for air.\n\n\nOh, that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. You normally wouldn\u2019t mind but you have plans tonight and have no time for conversation.  \n\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t agree with you often kid? That\u2019s too bad,\u201d you say while walking away.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, I\u2019m 20. But yeah, everyone I meet either ignores or makes fun of me. I almost prefer the latter as at least they keep me company,\u201d  he says while following behind you.\n\n\n\u201cDamn that really sucks,\u201d you stop walking and stare him in the eyes, \u201cLook I\u2019d love to keep you company, but I have somewhere very important to be.\u201d\n\n\nGreg looks at you with a face of disappointment. But he lights up to ask,\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you have to be? Maybe I could come with you.\u201d\n\n\nGah! As bad as you feel for Greg, under no circumstances could he come with you. She agreed to see you, not Greg and you.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod damn it. Can you at least tell me why? I don\u2019t want to be near Connor and Tom right now. They make me feel inhuman.\u201d\n\n\nDoes this guy ever shut up? You been trying to exit this conversation gracefully since it started. You should just tell him to fuck off and be done it. Of course, you could humor him and tell him what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s been hard keeping this succubus thing a secret and having someone to confide in wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world. On the other hand, you really want to go have demon sex.", "action_results": [null, null]}, null, null]}]}
