All sides have been at war for a long time, and also evenly matched. Who will win? It will all be decided on tonight.\n\n\u201cHey! Its time to go to bed!\u201d you Mom says coming into your room.\n\nOr at least it would be, if you didn\u2019t have to go to bed!\n\n\u201cAw Mom! I was just about to do something!\u201d you protest.\n\u201cWell you can do something tomorrow, right now its bedtime, you know the rules. But before you do remember to brush your teeth and put these toys away.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but can\u2019t I leave them out? I got everything set up and like everything! The final battle for the universe is going to take place!\u201d\n\nYour Mom surveys everything you\u2019ve set up. You have a myriad of unusual toys and figures standing next to each other. You have plastic knights standing next to space men defending a castle made of blocks on one side while across from them has a combination of green army guys in vehicles and some metal robots. And yet on the far side of your room is another army set up consisting of dinosaurs and some other monsters. She just smiles at your creativeness.\n\n\u201cVery well, it looks like you went to a lot of trouble, so okay. You certainly do have a vivid imagination to come up with some of the games you do.\u201d\n\nHappily you go brush your teeth, and think about the battle that\u2019s going to take place tomorrow! General Razor will try to storm the castle and Lord Justice will defend it! And then the Dino Demons will try to destroy everything! It\u2019s going to be so cool!\n\nAfter brushing your teeth, you head back to your room where you carefully step around the figures you\u2019ve set up with care and get into bed. Of course as usual, you don\u2019t fall asleep right away; you read a couple pages of your favorite comic book first. Man you wish real life wasn\u2019t as boring as it is. There\u2019s no magic, no super heroes, no giant robots, no nothing! You often wished you lived in a world with all of those things.\n\nYou turn off the lights in your room when your Mom checks on you again and demands you go to sleep. You\u2019re still a little to wound up to fall asleep though, so you just lie in your bed thinking how tomorrow\u2019s battle is going to play out.\n\nOf course one bad thing about having an overactive imagination is letting it run away with you. Your room is dark, with only the dim moonlight shining in and creating creepy shadows on your walls. You begin to think the shadows are moving, begin to get a little scared and hide under the covers. Then you think back to something your mom told you the last time you got scared like this: \u201cMonsters aren\u2019t real. Nothing like that exists in this world.\u201d\nOf course she\u2019s right, after all you just thought the world you lived in was boring by not having those types of things in it.\n\nYou slowly peer out from under your covers, but unfortunately this isn\u2019t the work of your imagination. These shadows ARE moving and now they\u2019re right by the side of your bed. Red dots form their eyes and a bluish light form their grinning maws. Before you can cry out, one of them puts its hand over your mouth and puts its other hand to its own with its index finger to its lips. (Or rather where its lips would be if it had any)\n\n\u201cShhhhhhh, the master wants to see you\u2026there will be plenty of time to cry then, little one. Open up the portal.\u201d The shadow says\n\nSuddenly a purple portal opens up where your closet is, and two of the shadow creatures grab and carry you into it. The shadows run around you as you\u2019re carried down the green tunnel which the portal has lead into. They excitedly talk about how their master will be pleased for getting you. Of course all you\u2019re doing right now is panicking, and you start to struggle to get away, surprisingly, you manage to break free of their grip and start trying to run back to where they entered this thing.\n\n\u201cGet him! He\u2019s trying to run away!\u201d\n\u201cDo it quickly before the portal starts collapsing!\u201d\n\nAs you hear the shadows giving orders to each other, the portal tunnel that you\u2019re in is indeed starting to flash and blink a lot, when you look down at your running feet, the purple light \u201csupporting\u201d you disappears every now and then revealing only blackness. You can see your room just up ahead and you ALMOST reach it, before the green tunnel disappears completely.\n\nYou yell and scream about how you wish you back home as you fall through the endless void, and while that doesn\u2019t happen, you do suddenly appear someplace else\u2026\n\nYou land roughly, scraping your legs and knees and getting your pajamas all dusty. After brushing yourself off and rubbing your hurting legs, you get a better look at your surroundings.\n\nYou\u2019re in what looks to be the middle of nowhere, though there is a small group of rickety looking houses nearby, probably a small village.\n\nOne thing is for certain, you know you aren\u2019t on Earth, because, a small multi-colored lizard like creature with three eyes scurries by your feet and into the wilderness beyond. You\u2019re still scared, but also fascinated by this place; however, you realize you need to figure out how to get back home and what exactly is going on.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to the village", "result": "Upon entering you see many of the villagers just sitting outside their houses doing nothing, though a couple of them are lazily plucking some sort of stringed instruments. They barely pay any attention to you at all.\n\nYou know you\u2019re not supposed to talk to strangers, but in this situation you don\u2019t really feel like you have a choice, so you ask one of them for help.\n\n\u201cHey, I need some help, these shadow things attacked me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWazzat? Shadows? Shadows don\u2019t come \u2018round here boy, we\u2019s got ourselves a wizard to protect us! If you got shadow problems, maybe you should talk to him. He\u2019s a pretty smart guy. He\u2019s in that nice lookin\u2019 house over there, the one with the roof! Careful though, he\u2019s usually in a bad mood. Argues with his wife constantly too.\u201d The fat villager says going back to drinking whatever it is he\u2019s drinking.\n\nNot knowing what else to do you head over to the wizard\u2019s house. As you approach you can hear arguing from the inside.\n\nYou knock on the door which is opened by a young woman dressed in a waitress like outfit. She\u2019s pretty, but looks very tired, behind her appears an older man who doesn\u2019t look much like a wizard at all.\n\n\u201cWhadda you want kid? We ain\u2019t buyin\u2019 anything!\u201d he scowls.\n\u201cAre you really a wizard? You don\u2019t look like one.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he isn\u2019t a real wizard. He\u2019s a lazy charlatan!\u201d the woman answers.\n\u201cShut up Talia, I was good enough to get YOU.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s because I was too young and na\u00efve to know any better! I knew I should\u2019ve married a knight!\u201d\n\u201cHah! And what knight would marry a serving wench like you?\u201d\n\u201cMelcar, I don\u2019t have time for your nonsense today, I have to go to work. Can you at least TRY to do something productive while I\u2019m gone, like casting some cantrips to cut down the overgrowth in the backyard? Sheesh, I think I saw a nest of Furms making their homes in there and you know much I hate those little purple things! They infest everything and then you can\u2019t get rid of them! So can you DO that one thing, if nothing else?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\n\nThe woman throws her hands up in dismay and leaves the house, leaving Melcar and you alone.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your deal kid? I know you ain\u2019t from this backwoods village because I know everyone here and you actually look like you bathe every once in awhile. You lost or something?\u201d\n\nYou explain your situation to Melcar, somehow he doesn\u2019t look surprised, but he does look a little more interested in you.\n\n\u201cHmm, sounds like the Nightmare Tyrant. He has a habit of snatching people from other dimensions and draining them to harness his power. Those shadows you encountered are what\u2019s left of his victims. I\u2019m not entirely sure of his methods for choosing, but I do know he only takes those with strong imaginations though. It\u2019s probably why he prefers children since they tend to be more inclined to think up fantastic things.\u201d You were lucky to escape from him.\u201d\n\u201cWell how do I get back home?\u201d\n\nMelcar looks at you a moment before replying.\n\n\u201cYou interested in doing a little yard work?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really busy with an experiment, and I just don\u2019t have time to mess around with clearing the overgrowth in my backyard. If you do it, I think that\u2019ll give me time to complete my experiment, as well as giving me time to look up the spell that can take you back home.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGood, there\u2019s a scythe in the back. You shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble.\u201d\n\nMelcar closes his door and you walk around the back, which literally looks like a jungle. The grass is almost as high as you are and the scythe is a little too unwieldy and large for you to use properly. Soon tiny purple people appear and angrily throw small stones at you and squeak some sort of jibberish. They apparently don\u2019t like you trying to tear up their home.\n\nYou don\u2019t see how you\u2019re ever going to finish this task.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}
