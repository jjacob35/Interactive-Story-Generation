You go through your normal morning routine and grudgingly head off to your job. As always, you arrive at work on time and walk straight into the back room to put on your uniform. Once there you notice your best friend, Ian, is already dressed and preparing to begin.\n\n\u201cHey Jake.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Ian, ready for another exciting day?\u201d You ask sarcastically.\n\n\u201cOh yea, working here has been highlight of my entire life.\u201d He replies with equal sarcasm, \u201cI hope I never quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, stocking food has always been a dream of yours hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lifelong-dream. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, it\u2019s time to live that dream.\u201d\n\nHe grabs a small nearby crate and rolls it into the main area of the store. You never thought he would end up as a stock boy in a grocery store. Then again, you thought both of you had bright futures. Although you were never really motivated to do anything, Ian was and certainly should have succeeded. You sigh and change into your uniform; this is your life and there\u2019s no point in brooding over what could have been.\n\nThe day goes by relatively quickly, which is about the only benefit to the job. However it\u2019s a rather hollow benefit, as the day passing by faster just means you have to work that much sooner the next day. You and Ian wave goodbye to each other at five o\u2019clock and you walk to your small one-bedroom apartment, reaching it by 5:30pm.", "action_results": [{"action": "A strange dream", "result": "You blink your eyes and look at your new surroundings. You\u2019re alone in the middle of a classroom, a very familiar classroom. Glancing down you notice you\u2019re sitting in a desk and that there\u2019s a small \u2018J\u2019 carved into the bottom right of its surface. This is your desk. At least it was, some point in time many years ago. Bringing your attention back up you notice the class is now filled with other students, each sitting in their own desks frantically writing notes. You don\u2019t recognize any of them, or rather you can\u2019t since none of their faces are clear to you. A teacher stands at the front of the class by the blackboard, presumably lecturing, though you all you can hear are muffled words.\n\nYou idly glance around the room and notice something out of place. A girl stands in the doorway, with long blonde and pink hair, flowing down to just above her waist. You stare at her for a while, trying to remember who she might be. No one else in the class pays any attention to her, and like the rest of them, you can\u2019t seem to make out her face. Suddenly, she turns around and runs down the hallway.\n\nYou stand up and walk out of the classroom, ignored completely by the rest of the class. As you enter the hallway, you look down the way you saw her ran, but see no one. Curious, you continue down the seemingly endless hallway trying to find her. Finally, you seem to reach the end, as a black metal door now blocks the path. Grasping the handle, you push it open. A bright light emits from the inside, blinding you and preventing you from seeing what\u2019s beyond the door. Curiosity gaining the better of you, you close your eyes and step through the doorway.", "action_results": [{"action": "The other side", "result": "\u201cJacob, wake up it\u2019s time for school!\u201d\n\nYou hear a familiar voice yell to you, and you groggily wake up in response.\n\nWhat a strange dream...\n\nYou try and remember the girl from your dream, but can\u2019t figure out who she was. The classroom was probably from your high school, but as far as you can remember that girl was never in any of your classes. You shrug and proceed to get up. After all, high school was years ago, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for you to forget a few people in that time.\n\nOnce fully awake, the reality that you live alone dawns on you; there should be no one yelling for you to wake up. Then another thought occurs, you don\u2019t go to school anymore either. Confused, you stand up and walk over to your dresser, which seems different from usual. Opening your drawers you notice your clothes seem different as well. Now even more confused, you get dressed and exit your room to find some answers. Outside your door you find your younger sister standing in front of you, in the uniform that she wore during high school. That is to say, while she has the same face, green eyes, and short brown hair as your sister, she looks considerably younger than she should.\n\n\u201cMom says wake up.\u201d She states quietly, then turns to walk away.\n\n\u201cUm, Tina?\u201d you say, trying to confirm it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d, she replies softly, turning towards you.\n\n\u201cAh, um, never mind. I\u2019m up.\u201d\n\nShe nods and walks away. You return to your room and look for your backpack, the one you remember using in high school. Sure enough you find it, right beside your dresser. You open it and grab one of your notebooks, hoping to confirm what you think has happened. You turn to the last note in the book and look at the date:\n\nApril 24th, 2008\n\nYou walk to your bed and sit down, trying accept what has happened. Yesterday was April 23th, but the year was 2018. Ten years ago you were 18 and in your last year of high school. The fact that your sister was in her private high school uniform confirms this, since she was in her first year of high school when you were in your last. Your thought process is interrupted by the familiar yell of your mother.\n\n\u201cJacob, hurry up! You\u2019re going to be late!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no point in thinking over this any longer. You quickly grab your bag and head down the stairs to the front door.\n\n\"Remember, you need wake up early on Saturday to bring your sister to school, since I'll be working.\"\n\nYour mother tells you, as she stands beside you watching you put on your shoes. You nod quickly in response, and although you\u2019re tempted to hug her or say you\u2019ve missed her, you put it off. The you in the past wouldn\u2019t have done it, so you\u2019re not going to do it either. After all, if this really is the past then doing something different could screw up the future in a major way.\n\nYou open the door and find Ian standing in front of you. Well, a younger version of him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time Jake, you goin' to school today or what?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes", "result": "\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nYou turn and wave goodbye to your mom, who waves in response, then quickly walk down your front porch to Ian. The two of you reach the sidewalk before you take a brief look back at the house.\n\nExactly as I remember it...\n\nThe walk to school is uneventful. Ian tells you some story involving his older brother but you don\u2019t really pay attention. The thought that you\u2019re ten years in the past is all you can think about.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\nIan pushes your shoulder once you reach the entrance of the school and the two of you stop. He has a concerned look on his face.\n\n\u201cYou alright? You sick or something?\u201d\n\nHe asks.\n\n\u201cHuh? No, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nYou walk ahead into the entrance of the school and Ian follows shortly after.", "action_results": [{"action": "Class", "result": "Although you roughly knew how to get to the school on your own, you have no idea what class you have. You follow Ian in hopes that you have the same first class together.

You walk down the hallway a little further before opening up your bag in hopes of finding some sort of clue telling you where you\u2019re supposed to be. Inside you find various notebooks and textbooks, but nothing concerning your schedule. You sigh and notice the hallway is now completely empty.\n\nThe final bell which marks the start of class should be ringing any minute and you have no idea where you\u2019re supposed to be. Unsure of what to do, you decide to sprint down the hallway and look for whatever seems familiar. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) you find two room numbers across from each other which seem somewhat familiar: Room 134 and Room 135. You\u2019ll have to guess which is the right room.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}, null]}]}]}
