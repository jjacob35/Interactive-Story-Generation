You sit in the back of Dad's Ford, staring out the window at shitty fields and forests.\n\n\n\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" your dad says, cheerfully looking out the window.\n\n\n\"Dad, I don't have bars on my phone. I genuinely didn't know there were places outside of Alaska in this country where that was possible.\"\n\n\n\"Well, maybe it'll encourage you to spend more time actually talking to people, or read. Hunter loves reading.\"\n\n\nYou look at your nine year old brother sitting next to your, his eyes glued to the screen of a Kindle.\n\n\n\"He's not reading; he's playing games. I told you he shouldn't have gotten a Kindle.\"\n\n\n\"Shut up, Hazel!\" he says.\n\n\nYou quickly thump him in the arm.\n\n\n\"Hey! Hazel hit me!\" Hunter whines.\n\n\n\"Hazel! What have I told you about hitting your brother?\"\n\n\n\"Do it when you're not looking?\" you ask sarcastically.\n\n\n\"For God's sake, Hazel, you're sixteen, act your age! I'm sick of your acting like a spoilt brat because of the move!\"\n\n\n\"You're dragging me from my home to the middle of bumfuck nowhere, of course I'm pissed!\"\n\n\nDad angrily slams his hands on the wheel, losing his cool once again.\n\n\n\"Stop swearing! I had to move here, I wasn't given a choice! The firm...\"\n\n\n\"There's plenty of other law firms! It's New York, there's not such a lack of crime you can't find work!\"\n\n\n\"That's another reason! New York was dangerous and full of crime. The only thing people die of where we're going is old age or eating too much fries!\"\n\n\n\"Fine, pick your job over us again!\"\n\n\nDad sighs as you pull out your headphones and put them in. You stare out the window as you pass through endless fields.", "action_results": [{"action": "One Hour Later...", "result": "An hour later, you pull into Dawnbrook, and find you were far too optimistic. The town is a shitty series of low buildings. Hunter looks up from his Kindle briefly, before shrugging and looking back down. You pull up to one of the many, generic looking houses pulling into the driveway.You can already see faces peeking out from windows at the new arrivals. Dad opens the car door and lugs two suitcases up to the door and fishes through his pocket for his keys and opens the door.\n\n\n\"Here we are! Home!\" he says cheerfully, obviously trying to raise his children's spirits.\n\n\nYou follow Dad inside, dropping your backpack on the floor.\n\n\n\"I'll begin unpacking, you guys can get settled in or go meet the neighbors or explore,\" Dad says.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go to your room", "result": "You pick up your backpack again and walk up to your new room. It has a large wardrobe, a large double bed, a desk and chair and two dressers. You sit on the bed, taking out your laptop, and go on Facebook. Thankfully, the WiFi's already set up, so you can go on. You go down your Timeline, seeing all your friends having fun. Fiona had a party, Dan's now dating Leone and a bunch of other shit's going on that you wish you could take part in. You sigh, and continue flicking through pictures and posts. After an hour or two, Dad calls you down again. You close your laptop and go downstairs, finding Dad waiting there in the kitchen.\n\n\n\"Hey, sweetie. The house is pretty barren, so we're going to go out to eat and I'll pick up groceries in the morning. I saw a pizza place in town. Do you want to go?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Sure.\"", "result": "\"Oh, good! Come on, let's go!\"\n\n\nYou follow Dad to the car, and climb in the passenger seat. You don't even need to turn your head to know your brother's in the backseat, hearing the opening tune of Angry Birds: Stalin's Show Trials or whatever the fuck version they have now. You lie back in your seat and stare out the window as you go through the town. Eventually, you arrive at some shitty, greasy pizza joint, and get out of the car. You walk inside, and find yourself in a Chucky Cheese knock-off. You walk up to the counter and find yourself faced with a girl your age with long brown hair and a massive zit that looks like a red dot sight in the middle of her forehead.\n\n\n\"Hello, welcome to Pizza Corner, can I take your order?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"Yeah, can we have a large Pepperoni Pizza and three Cokes?\"\n\n\n\"Sure thing. Small, Medium or Large?\"\n\n\n\"Medium.\"\n\n\nThe girl begins pouring the drinks as another, far prettier blond girl appears from the kitchen, holding a large piece of dough. She glances briefly at you, before grabbing a cloth with her spare hand and disappearing back again.\n\n\n\"So, are you new here?\" the cashier asks.\n\n\n\"Yeah, I just moved in.\"\n\n\n\"I'm Lucy.\"\n\n\n\"I'm Hazel.\"\n\n\n\u201cOh, really? Well, it\u2019s a good town. You can\u2019t find much work except in a dull pizza joint, but there ain\u2019t much here to even spend the money on. Some old clothes stores and a cinema, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you work here full time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJesus no. If I got to the point where I was working here full time I\u2019d dip my head in the deep fat\u2026 well, I wouldn\u2019t be happy. Im still in school.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat grade?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c10th.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m starting there tomorrow. I guess I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u201dSure. If you want, I can always get you a job here. Becca, the blond girl, has literally done shit all since we started. She\u2019s only working so her daddy an think she\u2019s learning real-life experience and still feel justified buying whatever she\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can hear you!\u201d a voice calls out from the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cI know, Becca, I\u2019m getting a point across!\u201d\n\n\nDad appears standing next to you, grinning.\n\n\n\"Look who's already making friends!\" he smiles.\n\n\nYou roll your eyes.\n\n\n\"Yeah, sure. Let's just sit down,\" you say, pulling Dad towards a booth to sit in.", "action_results": [null, null]}, null]}, null]}]}
