You don't know where you are. You can't remember a thing. You don't even know your own name. If only you could remember where you were. You knew it once, but no more. Where am I? With a sudden thud, the swirling stops. You are lying face down in the dirt. The smell of grass meets your nose. You push yourself up slowly until you can look around. You are alone on a grassy plain. All around you you can see nothing but the swaying of green blades. You stand up and scratch your head. Where are you? You begin to wander about in the grassland but nothing seems to change. You may not have moved for all you can see. You stop to take a break. As you look around again, you notice that the grass is redder than you remember. Well you can't remember anything else properly so you dismiss it. You begin to walk again but stop almost immediately. The grass is definitely redder than before. As if waiting for the revelation, the plains turn blood red and the grass crumbles, leaving you standing in a dusty wasteland. You see movement out of the corner of your eye but when you turn to look at the spot where you saw it, there is nothing there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Investigate", "result": "Curious, you approach the spot where you saw the motion. There is a hole there. How did you not see that before? Leaning closer, you spy something at the bottom. A faint twinkle of light like a mirror in the sun. Something pushes you forward. The light grows larger and larger until it envelops you. \n\n\nYou feel wind on your face as you fly through the sky, dipping and diving like a bird. Suddenly, you remember that you can't fly. You tumble through the air. Beneath you, you can see the earth getting nearer and nearer.", "action_results": [{"action": "Land in water", "result": "If you land in the water you might survive. You see it coming up to meet you. But then, the water turns to cement. You scream and try to save yourself. There's nothing you can do. You close your eyes, waiting for the crash.\n\n\nGasping, you sit up in bed. Your eyes dart around your bedroom. Sighing with relief, you fall back in bed. It was only a dream. It was only a dream.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Land on the ground", "result": "You smash into the ground but in bends like a trampoline and you are hurled back into the air. Falling again, you once again bounce. This is fun. You laugh gleefully. You land again and sink right through the ground.\n\n\nYou are digging through the earth with a shovel. There is something following you. You have to keep digging. It's your only chance of survival. You here footsteps drawing nearer. You turn to face the threat but you see only a cat. That's odd. You could have sworn that there was something chasing you. Suddenly the cat begins to transform into a ferocious beast with claws and teeth.", "action_results": [{"action": "Surrender to it", "result": "There is nothing for it. You can't escape the beast. You close your eyes and huddle in a corner. You hear it closing in on you. You feel claws raking across your chest. You're going to die!\n\n\nGasping, you sit up in bed. Your eyes dart around your bedroom. Sighing with relief, you fall back in bed. It was only a dream. It was only a dream.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Keep digging", "result": "No. If you can just keep digging it won't catch you. You bury your shovel in the wall. Hands reach out and grab you. You scream as they drag you through the wall. You emerge in a theme park. You find yourself holding a bunch of tickets in one hand and a giant roll of cotton candy in the other. Running forward excitedly you jump in line for a roller coaster. You realize you must be falling asleep, your vision is fading. Then everything goes black.\n\n\nYou open your eyes sleepily. Your alarm clock is beeping incessantly. You sigh sadly. It had been such a good dream too.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Run", "result": "You turn and begin to run but you move slowly as if you are running through syrup. You see movement again, and once again you see nothing when you look where you saw it. Fear seizes you and you try to run but you stumble and fall over. You get up and fall again. You feel something closing in behind you but you are too afraid to look back. Suddenly you are falling again. But this time all you can see is blackness. You feel as if you are being watched. As if something is waiting for your guard to drop. You hit the ground and quickly rise to your feet. You can see nothing. Nothing except a pair of huge, glowing eyes. You stumble backwards as those eyes focus on you. ", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack it", "result": "Maybe you can scare off this beast. You stand as tall as you can and shout at it. Advancing as if it was merely a rabbit before you. Suddenly you feel a terrible pain in your arm and, you hear something swipe through the air. The eyes advance on you and something knocks you to the ground. You hear heavy breathing over you. A tremendous roar echoes around you as a pair of massive jaws snaps down on you.\n\n\nGasping, you sit up in bed. Your eyes dart around your bedroom. Sighing with relief, you fall back in bed. It was only a dream. It was only a dream.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run", "result": "You don't know what that thing is but you don't intend to find out. You turn away from those eyes and begin to run in the opposite direction. You glance hastily behind you. The eyes are no further away, in fact, they appear closer. You run harder but those eyes keep gaining ground on you. All of a sudden light surrounds you and the eyes are gone. Where is this new place you have come to? You squint your eyes against the intense light but nothing appears to be there. You take a step and find yourself on a ship in the middle of the ocean. There are sharks all around you. One leaps up on the deck and begins to wriggle towards you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack it", "result": "You charge forward and leap on top of the shark which thrashes about, trying to shake you off. You hold on like a cowboy in a rodeo. The shark jumps off of the boat. You realize that it is actually a dolphin. You grab its fin as it swims away. Fish swirl around you but you suddenly can't breathe. You let go of the dolphin and flail about as you try to swim to the surface but slowly sink deeper. Then suddenly you can breath again. As you look at yourself you realize that you are a fish. How could you have forgotten. You can feel the water flowing around you, see the bright colors of a reef. But then the colors begin to fade and your vision begins to go dark.\n\n\nYou open your eyes sleepily. Your alarm clock is beeping incessantly. You sigh sadly. It had been such a good dream too.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Run", "result": "Fear grips you and you run away from the shark. But the ship starts to tilt. It is becoming increasingly difficult to run. You grab onto one of the ship's masts as the ship reaches 90 degrees. Hanging from the wooden beam you look in fear at the roiling ocean far below. You can feel your fingers slipping. Then you are falling, screaming as you do so. You can see the water coming up to meet you.\n\n\nGasping, you sit up in bed. Your eyes dart around your bedroom. Sighing with relief, you fall back in bed. It was only a dream. It was only a dream.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}
