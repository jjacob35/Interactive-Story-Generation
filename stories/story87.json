{"tree_id": "http://chooseyourstory.com/story/viewer/default.aspx?StoryId=11906", "context": "", "first_story_block": " You wake up in some dimly illuminated room with a damn headache, and the first thing you notice is that you are really thirsty. You also notice that you are not \u201cin\u201d the bed, but instead you are simply on top of it, dressed in a really creased gray suit, and apparently you didn\u2019t even bother taking off your shoes. All of this makes you think \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m never drinking that much alcohol again in my whole life\u201d.\n\n  But there seems to be something weird in this whole situation: You can\u2019t remember what clubs did you visit last night, or what did you drink at them. Hell, you can\u2019t even remember whether you went out last night or not (even if the answer to that question seems pretty obvious). And what is worse, you don\u2019t have a clue about who the hell are you or where the hell is this place, now that you think about it.\n\n  And since that\u2019s really creepy, you think \u201cNah, this must be a dream, I\u2019ll wake up soon enough and then I\u2019ll laugh at my own stupidity\u201d. But until you wake up from such a hateful dream, you should do something\u2026 \u201cHell no, there\u2019s no reason to get up in such a hateful dream as this one, screw it\u201d you think as you turn yourself to find a more comfortable position to sleep.\n\n  You try to remember if you had seen some horror movie or whatever thing that could justify such a crappy dream, but you realize there\u2019s no way to find something like that out without your memories. And while you keep thinking in these deep, sort of pointless, thoughts, you fall asleep again. And suddenly:\n\n\n Voice of a Man: \u201cAAAAAAAAA Who are you and what the **** are you doing here?!\u201d\n\n You: \u201cFuck! Who are you?\u201d\n\n Man: \u201cWhat the\u2026 You are sleeping in MY house and you dare asking me who am I?\u201d\n\n You: \u201cEh\u2026 Well, yes\u2026 Why wouldn\u2019t I do it? I don\u2019t remember having ever seen you in my life. And who says this is your place?\u201d\n\n Man: \u201c\u2026 O.o\u2026 \u00ac\u00ac Get the hell out of here right now or I\u2019ll call the police\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Try convincing him that you are just a poor human being lost, scared, and unsure :(", "result": " You: \u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026 I can\u2019t remember how did I make it to this place, or who am I, or\u2026 you are the only person that can help me! :(\u201d\n\n Man: \"How did a fucking junkie get in my house\u2026?\u201d\n\n You: \u201cNo! I swear it\u2019s true! I can\u2019t remember anything, if you kick me out of here I won\u2019t even know where to go to :(\u201d\n\n Man: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll hate myself for doing this later, but\u2026 Let\u2019s say I believe you. What do you suggest I do? The only thing I can think of is that the police might know something about you. But you probably should just go straight to a psychiatrist\u2026 er\u2026 doctor. Or perhaps a hypnotist so you can do a regression, or however those are called. Actually, I know a hypnotist\u2026\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The word 'Hypnotist' sounds cool and awesome, and possibly helpful here", "result": " You tell him to call the hypnotist, and he suggests you go sit down in the living room while he  finds the number and phones him. In the living room, you notice a black leather wallet that looks pretty badass, so you grab it thinking it might be yours, and open it.\n\n Inside it you find a bunch of cards and identifications, all of them with different names. Before you can think any more into it, the owner of the flat comes back and informs you that the hypnotist has some free time in 20 minutes, so you should get going. You ask the man if the wallet is yours. He says he\u2019s never seen it in his life, so you put it in your right pocket, noticing right then and there that you also have a lighter in that pocket for some reason.\n\n The man must have been pretty happy about you leaving, because you got perfectly clear directions and reached the building where the hypnotist works in no time. Once you are in his \u201coffice\u201d, he tells you to close your eyes, something about a brilliant white light surrounding you, and whatever else they use to make you fall asleep\u2026 I mean, enter in a trance\n\n It seems to have worked, because you have the feeling of having been asleep for a while now. You look at the hypnotist\u2019s face, and notice he\u2019s staring at you as if you were something weirder and more creepy than a pink-stripped white alien. You eventually gather enough courage to ask him what he got out of the session, and the hypnotist starts reading his notepad in a voice devoid of any emotions:\n\n \u201cFirstly, you said you see yourself, aged 15, talking happily to some friends, until you all see a bunch of dragons flying over your heads and one of your friends say \u201cOh shit, I knew this town was fucked. How about we run?\u201d, thing you all agree with. You run through the field and eventually take shelter in a castle. Soon after that, an army of angry dwarfs sieges the castle, and you have to fight them\n\n Next scene is about you running through a highschool filled with zombies, until you find your goal: The garden. You walk around there and notice the guy you hate sitting next to a beautiful well. You turn to walk in the opposite direction thinking \u201cthis guy isn\u2019t going to mess with my day!\u201d, but suddenly you stop and say: \u201cthen again, I doubt I\u2019ll ever have a better chance of doing this...\u201d You run up to him and kick him straight into the well, in a slow motion movement that is repeated from 3 different angles\n\n Now you are feeling really dizzy inside a hospital\u2019s room, some blond guy is helping you out of there. He says his name is Dani, and that he wants to \u201csave your ass\u201d. He drags you through the hospital, and eventually gets you out of there and throws you inside a car. He then stops and lets you somewhere, telling you he\u2019ll be in contact with you, and if you can\u2019t find him, go to Decasibar\n\n\n Finally, you are at the first plant of a hotel with \"some stereotyped characters, the kind you see in teenagers movies: The nerd, the evil tough guy who thinks highly of himself, the 2 blonde stupid girls who are best-est friends, the black man,the lonely bitch and the hot guy\", in your own words. You all have to participate in a Battle Royale-like game, you see every single fucking death and give a long list of dark details I will *not* mention. In short, the friends kill the black guy, the tough guy kills the hotter one, then the friends deal with the loner, the nerd kills tough guy (thianks to his knowledge of horror movies, he knew exactly where was the guy going to attack him from, and he managed to shoot him through the door), the 2 friends kill each other by activating some trap and the nerd runs away\n\n A weird man armed with a giant wirecutter appears and tells you \u201cLots of people can\u2019t appreciate their lives. But not you. Not anymore\u201d, you answer \u201cBut I didn\u2019t even do a thing, the nerd did kill someone, though\u201d. He comments \u201cOh, you are honest. Now you\u2019ve really won, he will live too\u2026 but first\u2026 You must pass a trial\u201d. Apparently he wants to cut a finger off your left hand, you oppose the idea, and he says \u201cLISTEN YOU IDIOT, IT\u2019S YOUR FINGER OR YOUR LIFE\u201d. So you nod, he cuts it and stores it in a plastic bag, and then bids farewell to you, smiling\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cEh\u2026 hehehe\u2026 I see...\u201d\n\nHypnotist: \u201cGet out of here now before I call a psychiatric, you fucking piece of shit on crack\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cYeah, great idea\u201d\n\n You run out of the building, in your hurry your wallet fell off your pocket -.- oh well, you are definitely not going back to the poor hypnotist. Not in a week, at least. That must have been tough on him. And hey, at least you still have the lighter, which is a golden, pretty cool-looking one. You walk in no direction until you see a bar in front of you. Called \u201cKasi bar\u201d. Didn\u2019t you say something that sounded like that in your insane rambling? Something about a Dani guy telling you to go there? Well, you won\u2019t lose a thing for trying, will you?", "action_results": [{"action": "Enter the Kasi bar", "result": " You get in the bar, which at this time of the day (whatever it is) is nearly empty. You order a beer after telling the barman that \u201cDani recommended this place\u201d and you are given one without any questions, which makes you happy (and worries you. Who the hell is Dani?)\n\n You sit down in a table by the darkest corner of the place and wonder if you should ask someone about Dani, although you are not sure about whether you can trust him or whether he'll be any helpful. But then again you got a free beer by just mentioning his name, which makes him cool :D\n\n Suddenly, asking someone else becomes unnecessary, since Dani, dressed in a yellow tracksuit with a couple of black lines that looks slightly familiar to you for a couple of seconds, enters the bar, looks at you, and says:\n\nDani: \u201cAAAH, that\u2019s how I like it! You accepted my invitation!\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cEh\u2026 I'm sorry but\u2026 who are you?\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cBad memory? I got you out of the fuckin\u2019 hospital where they were turning you into a mindless soldier with weird skills\u201d\n\nYou: \u201c... What?\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cYou know, I know this is going to sound pretty strange to you, but it all started the day you met my sister. Fuckin\u2019 girl is one of them\u2026 So they tracked you, and then you were posioned. But just like they expected you to do, you survived with no poisonin\u2019 symptoms at all.\n\nSo they went straight to phase 2, a.k.a \u201cmix of random drugs that can be natural, artificial, or plain crap\u201d. As in, they injected that shit in your blood\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cHAHAHAHA yeah, sure\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cI know right? it does sound fuckin' weird. Nearly as much as your rantin\u2019s as I kicked your ass out of the hospital (they included dragons and bizarre murders, true story). But as I was sayin\u2019, they injected you some new mix and waited to see what effect it\u2019d have on ya, or if it\u2019d simply kill ya. While they were at it, they used this little girl to erase your memories, just to make sure ya wouldn\u2019t try escaping from the place out of nostalgic feelings for your previous life.\n\nPhase 3, ya never reached this one because I got ya out of the place. If you, my friend, had died, your corpse would have been disposed of. If you had survived but showed no signs of an ability, they\u2019d prepare a new mix and retry. Finally, if ya got a new skill, they\u2019d help you to control that \u2018power\u2019, and eventually ya would have been sent to do some missions.\u201d\n\nYou: \u201c\u2026 Dude\u2026 There\u2019s no way I\u2019m believing that, and you know it, right?\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cOf course I do, but I had to try :D Anyways, believe it or not, there\u2019re at least 2 groups out there trying to find you: One of them wants to kill ya, since they have some funny \u201cnothin\u2019 gets out of here\u201d policy, and the other one wants ya to join them (I dunno what are their plans, though)\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cAnd how can you know that?\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cWhy, because their funny experiment on me gave me an attempt at being omniscient. I didn't get *THE* omniscience, but I got to know some useful things. For instance I may find a credit card and know its secret number right then and there, or I can know at any time where are some specific objects located, so I can have someone located if I want it. For instance, I could just stick a lighter into his pocket and whenever I want to talk to him I\u2019ll just go to him and say \u2018hey, have ya got a light?\u2019\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cWait, that thing you just said\u2026\u201d\n\nDani: \u201cYeah, ya don\u2019t need omniscience to know the lighter in your pocket is mine. Sorry, I ain\u2019t gonna get your memories or your previous life back, I just can\u2019t do that. But we can end with the makers of weird people\u2019s organization. The only reason why I hadn\u2019t left the place until the day I got you outta there was that I knew perfectly well that there was no way I could finish them. That is, until your apparition in the picture, when at last I had an option :D So what\u2019d ya say, will ya help me do this?\u201d", "action_results": [null, null]}]}, null]}]}
