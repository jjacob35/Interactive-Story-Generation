You both are really getting into it.\n\nAfter watching this spontaneous act of S&M/Rape everyone goes back to doing what they were doing. From then on in, Kate hangs around you a lot more (Much to Phil\u2019s dismay) and you forget all about Marina, in fact you don\u2019t even see her in the whole time during this Armageddon party.

You wonder if you would\u2019ve actually had a shot with her if things had been normal, oh well you guess you\u2019ll never know.\n\nYou quietly make your way through the room and head up to the top floor and onto the roof of the building. The city is deadly quiet. You don\u2019t hear a sound except the wind gently blowing. In all the revelry you\u2019ve been indulging in, you forgot how much you liked the solitude and silence.\n\nThe loneliness is peaceful.\n\nYou look up in the sky, shielding your eyes from the sun shining down.\n\nYou see a bright light and then nothing at all.", "action_results": []}, null]}, null]}, null]}]}
