You stumble toward your dorm room, brain turned to mush from taking five exams in three days.\n\n\nAll you have to do is grab your suitcase, and then you\u2019ll be on your way to NYC to stay with your boyfriend, Keith, and his parents for Christmas. You\u2019ve never met them, but he\u2019s told you that they have a large, luxurious apartment with a pool--which sounds awesome, but intimidating. \n\n\nAnyway.\n\n\nKeith, the lucky son of a gun, has already flown out. (He\u2019s a creative writing major. His exams consist of writing poems about his childhood and writing essays about the meaning of life.)\n\n\nYou pause in the hallway (which is empty--almost everyone else has finished exams and gotten the heck out of here.) Like every college dorm room in every movie ever, there's a whiteboard on your door.\n\n\nNow there's an \"I Heart NY\" magnet on there. The magnet holds a postcard with a photo of the Statue of Liberty. You're pretty sure it wasn't there when you left this morning. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Probably for your roommate.

You aren't usually one to use the word vibe, but the whole atmosphere gives you a slightly sick feeling, as if your body is absorbing their stress. \n\n\n \n\nYou board the plane for the six-hour flight to your connection, Atlanta. Halfway through, you use the lav.\n\n\n \n\nWhen you return, there's a postcard on your seat. This one shows a picture of the Empire State Building. You turn it over.\n\n\n \n\nBlack, scrawling letters read:\n\n\n \n\nDear Clara,\n\n\nWhen you get off, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll find you. \n\n\nWhen I find you, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll kill you.\n\n\nWhen you run, better run fast.\n\n\nWhen you hide, better hide good.\n\n\nWhen you tell, it makes things worse.\n\n\n \n\nPanic clenches your throat.

Her white teeth glitter.\n\n\nYou show another flight attendant with similar results.\n\n\nOkay, this isn\u2019t going so well. What should you do? Start screaming for help, or just sit there, like, well, a sitting duck?\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Scream.", "result": " \n\nImmediately, the co-captain comes out and helps the flight attendants handcuff you. You try to show them the postcard, but it slips out of your hand.\n\n\n \n\nThey lecture you about causing a panic to the other passengers. The escort you to an empty seat and check your vital signs to rule out medical issues, as they are trained to do, and then bring you a glass of wine to help you stop panicking (as they are also trained to do). You don\u2019t drink it, of course--you need your wits about you. Because something is seriously screwed up.\n\n\n \n\nWhen the flight attendant returns to collect the still-full wine glass, you ask her if you\u2019re on some kind of list now, or if you\u2019ll be allowed to board your next flight.\n\n\n \n\nShe smiles. \u201c Don\u2019t cause another disturbance, or there will be consequences.You must continue with the itinerary on your ticket.\u201d\n\n\n \n\nHer tone is different--still creepily calm, but less robotic. There\u2019s more of a sense that she might actually have a soul. This leads you, of course, to ask more questions, but she cuts you off saying she must clear the cabin for arrival.\n\n\n \n\nThe plane lands. What should you do--go to the TSA and tell them what\u2019s going on, or just run and hope the killer doesn\u2019t find you? ", "action_results": [{"action": "Inform TSA.", "result": " \n\nYou go to your airline\u2019s main desk and ask to speak to a TSA agent.\n\n\nThe uniformed attendant, who isn\u2019t much older than you but looks like she has a ton more responsibility, smiles briskly and pulls something up on her computer. \u201cYes, Miss Conner--we were wondering if you\u2019d stop by. Follow me.\u201d\n\n\nShe leads you into what looks like a small conference room. Four leather chairs are arranged around a shiny wooden table. At one end of the room is a Keurig machine, a small fridge, and a bowl of apples. \u201cWould you like something to drink while you wait?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe agent should be in here shortly, and he\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d\n\n\nYou meant to ask her some questions, but the kindness in her voice--as well as the promise that everything is finally going to start making sense--almost brings you to tears. You accept a bottle of water and sit quietly.\n\n\nThe man who comes in is holding a manila file folder. He has no face.\n\n\nWell, he has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but they have no distinguishing features. He\u2019s like a mannequin, except there\u2019s nothing mechanical about his movements. He\u2019s clearly real, just blank.\n\n\n\u201cHello, Ms. Conner.\u201d\n\n\nFear is rising through your throat like smoke.  This is a trap--this is just what the killer wanted.\n\n\nHe smiles comfortingly. \u201cOh, no, Ms. Conner--I\u2019m not here to kill you. That\u2019s not my job. Shall I leave the door open? You may leave whenever you like.\u201d He props it open and takes the seat opposite you, leaving you closer to the exit. A flat laugh. \u201cOf course, leaving would mean starting the running part, which you may not be ready to do. I\u2019m not sure I blame you there!\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same tone you use with your boyfriend\u2019s parents on Skype. Jovial, polite. A voice for small talk.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway, while you\u2019re here, I\u2019m supposed to go over the rules with you.\u201d He opens the folder. \u201cRules are optional\u2026\u201d he reads, almost to himself. \u201cWe went over that. Okay, here we are. \u2018If you are being briefed, you have been exceedingly stubborn in contacting the authorities. Stubbornness has both benefits and drawbacks, which we will discuss at the end.\n\n\n\u201cThe following are the rules: you will run. They will try to catch you. You can run, hide, or fight. If they catch you, if they overpower you, you will die.\n\n\n\u201cBut you will not ask for help from people of higher authority than yourself. If you continue to fail to accept the situation, you will lose, and losing this game will not be pleasant. You are safe when you cross the threshold of 333 Madison Avenue.\u201d\n\n\nHe looks at you. \u201cDo you need any part of that repeated?\u201d he asks politely. \u201cOr some coffee?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut why is this happening? What\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugs, eyes flitting over the documents. \u201cI don\u2019t see a point.\u201d\n\n\nRight. Let\u2019s try another tack. \u201cWhat do I have that they want?\u201d\n\n\nHe reads from the paper again. \u201c'You can run, hide, or fight.'\u201d\n\n\nNot helpful. \u201cCan I see what else is in the folder?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\nHe slides it across the table. On top is the paper he just read, typed in ordinary Times New Roman.\n\n\nBehind that is another sheet with what appears to be a dossier on you--your full name, birthdate, social security number, height, weight, hair and eye color, GPA, hometown, high school, and a short medical and dental history. The GPA is current as of the exams you just finished taking.\n\n\nPersonal life, it says, like on Wikipedia.\n\n\nConner is of Irish, Scottish, and American Indian descent. She enjoys photography, reading, and hiking. She is affiliated with no particular religion. Her flaws include an irregular flossing routine and passivity.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\n\n\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d These aren\u2019t really the right words, because actually these papers are boring--pointedly boring, like they\u2019ve been created to mock you.\n\n\nYou ask more questions--why you, why the teeth, how did they get this--but Faceless guy just gives you more polite non-answers.\n\n\nSuddenly something rather obvious strikes you. You\u2019ve been dealing with this like it\u2019s an airport emergency, but it\u2019s bigger than that. You have your phone, and it\u2019s got plenty of charge. Why not call the police?\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Get Faceless Guy to leave, then call the police.", "result": " \n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you manage, trying to imitate the polite, professional tone he\u2019s been using on you. \u201cThis is all...very strange.
