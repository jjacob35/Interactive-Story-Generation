Your oldest brother, Bagig, appears in the doorway of the hut.\n\n\n\"Dag!\" he shouts, \"Come on! We have an appointment with Lurkhim Deathforge.\"\n\n\nBagig stands at 6'4 and towers over you. His green skin ripples with muscles that make his black tattoos of wolves and bears ripple as his sharp teeth curve into a grin. Despite being a fearsome monster that would make most men run in terror, he's the kindest of your brothers and probably one of the nicest Orcs in the village. You nod, and eagerly rush over to follow him as he begins walking towards the center of the village.\n\n\n\"Now, promise me you won't tell Mama what we're doing. I can imagine her shrieking. 'Oh, Bagig! What were you thinking, giving a sword and dagger to an eight year old!' She'd howl louder than a dragon that's lost its tail!\"\n\n\nYou giggle, smiling at your brother.\n\n\n\"Still, you're an Orc, for fuck's sake! What does she expect you to do? We were born to spill blood.\"\n\n\nEventually, you come across the stone forge. Rows of iron swords, axes and maces are stacked there. Lurkhim appears behind the forge, working on a large war axe. She's heavily scarred from years of battle and forging accidents, her face being so scarred you can barely tell if she's angry or cheerful.\n\n\n\"Hello! Look who it is, it's Dagden Youngblood! You're getting so big, aren't you? Big enough for a sword, hmmm?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Lurkhim.\"\n\n\n\"Damn right you are. I had a sword twice my height at your age. Ran it through a neighboring boy who tried to take my apples, I recall. Ah, the days of youth.\"\n\n\nShe leads you over to the weapons rack, and picks out a tiny dagger.\n\n\n\"There. Try it out. It should be well balanced for someone of your height.\"\n\n\nYou look at the blade, filled with disappointment, and Lurkhim bursts into laughter.\n\n\n\"Ha! I'd be ashamed to give that to a baby!\" she says, grabbing a much larger sword from a rack.\n\n\n\"Here. Stain it red, Dagden. May your life be long and your enemies' short.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Take a few practice swings", "result": "You take a few swings of your blade. It takes some effort and strength to properly swing the heavy blade, but it does work quite well.\n\n\n\"Hey! Watch it, you little shit!\" Bagig growls, as you realize you've sliced open his knee.\n\n\n\"Oops.\"\n\n\n\"He's already drawn blood. A promising start,\" Lurkhim grins.\n\n\n\"We're not called Red Blades for nothing,\" Bagig says, rubbing dirt into the cut.\n\n\n\"Sheath your blade, Dag, you're not in a battle yet, despite how much you may hope,\" she says, handing over a tiny leather belt that looks custom made for you. \n\n\nYou put the belt on and quickly sheath the weapon.\n\n\n\"Now, shall we get you a dagger? A dagger for Dag? Fitting.\"\n\n\nYou nod eagerly, as she takes you over to a row of knives. You look through them.\n\n\n\"Go ahead. Pick your favorite. You can tell a lot about an Orc from the dagger he picks. Whether it's gilded or plain, big or small, large or short...\"\n\n\nYou quickly eye your favorite.\n\n\n\"That one.\"\n\n\nLurkhim laughs, picking it up. It's a deadly sharp knife made of bone, simple yet elegant.\n\n\n\"Ha! I like your choice! So many boys your age pick the biggest or the shiniest. You know what you want, Dagden.\"\n\n\nYou smile, as she hands you the knife.\n\n\n\"Keep it in your boot, so you always have it. An Orc should never be caught without a blade handy. Do you know what kind of knife that is, Dagden? What kind of bone is it?\"", "action_results": [null, null, null, null, null]}]}
