The other eggs have hatched, giving you three more baby dragons to play with. You are all a different color. You are red, your sister is yellow, your other sister is blue, and your brother is green. Your mother walks into the cave with a sheep in her powerful jaws. After you all eat your share she speaks:\n\n\n\"Now that you are al hatched, if have to give you your names.\" She looks towards the yellow one, \"You will be Lightning.\" She turns to the blue one, \"You will be Splash.\" She looks at the green one, \"You will be Leaf.\" Finally, she looks at you, \"And you, will be Flame.\"\n\n\nFlame, you think, I like that name.\n\n\n\"Now that I've given you your names,\" the large red and black she-dragon starts, \"let me give you mine. My name is Ember. Your father's name is Drop.\"\n\n\nAnother dragon, who you presume to be your father, walks into the cave. He is blue with white spots, the opposite of your mother. He is also a tad larger than your mother.\n\n\nYou play around with your siblings for the rest of the day and then go to sleep.", "action_results": [{"action": "*wake up*", "result": "You wake up the next day and you want to explore. You gather up your brother and sisters and head out when your parents aren't looking.\n\n\nAfter a while, you finally come to the entrance of the cave. After you adjust to the sunlight you find a whole valley full of dragons that look like your mother and father. You look around and see many caves on every side. But there is one cave that is drawing your attention. You and your siblings walk over to this strange den. It feels as if it was your destiny to go inside. You walk inside to see a very frail and elderly dragon.\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asked in a raspy tone.\n\n\n\"I'm Flame,\" you respond warmly, \"And this is Leaf, Lightning, and Splash.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you closer, and lets out a small gasp, though not loud enough for you to hear. \" Who are you parents?\" He asks, curious to know more about you.\n\n\n\"Ember and Drop,\" you say and he lets out another inaudible gasp, \"Why?\" You ask.\n\n\n\"Oh, I, umm...\" He was interrupted by your parents walking in. \"Kids! Why are you bothering Elder Olvin?\"\n\n\n\"So that's his name,\" you respond.\n\n\n\"Oh that's okay, it's quite fine.\" Elder Olvin replies.\n\n\n\"Kids, come on, back to the cave.\" Your siblings groan unhappily and walk with their parents, but you stay behind, because Elder Olvin said to stay for a minute.\n\n\n\"There is a prophecy,\" he begins to tell you, \"There will be four, children of ember and drop, who will rid the world of plague with their pure minds. That prophecy is about you and your siblings, Flame.\" You start to breathe hard. You turn around and walk out and back to your cave.", "action_results": [{"action": "A month later", "result": "A month passes and it is time for you to leave your cave with your siblings. You find a cave and live there with your siblings. You and your siblings are now big enough to hunt for your own food, but you've never had any experience. Luckily, your mother had taught you the best times, places, and ways to hunt. You and your siblings each take turns going out to hunt, like what your parents did when you were hatchlings. You are living a simple life.\n\n\nBut every once in a while you think about the prophecy given to you by Olvin. You start to realize it's meaning. Ember and drop meant their parents, and there were four of them, but you couldn't figure out what the rest was about. Rid the world of plague? Pure minds? All you knew was that you wanted to be a normal dragon, just like everyone else.", "action_results": [{"action": "Save", "result": "In order to save your progress, you need to have an account and be logged into the site.\nTo logon, click here to open the logon screen in a new window.
