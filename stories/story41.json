It either is or it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno I lost the list.\u201d\n\u201cYou what? That\u2019s just great. You realize how much we\u2019re going to get our asses chewed out because of your fuck up? I\u2019m sick of paying for your mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cWill you calm down? How the hell are they gonna know anyway? You seen one ugly little baldy, you\u2019ve seen \u2018em all. All babies look the same.\u201d\n\u201cNot the elven ones.\u201d\n\u201cEnough with your elf fetish. These babies are all under the care of the Empire anyway, they\u2019re here for the taking.\n\u201cYeah, the key word being the Empire. You know we need the proper paper work, which you just fucking lost!\u201d\n\u201cSo what, I can forge it. You really worry too much, there\u2019s so much red tape they ain\u2019t gonna know the difference and what does it matter? The Empire\u2019s getting a body for their purposes anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you know how they like the best.\u201d\n\u201dHow the fuck can they really tell at this age? They do all the real testing later. Look he\u2019s got all his limbs, and he doesn\u2019t display any signs of impurity. I\u2019d say he\u2019s a prime candidate for whatever they have in store for this poor little bastard.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess\u2026damn. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like being brought up like that.\u201d\n\u201cMe either, this program has only been going on a few years, but I\u2019ve already heard some fucked up stories about it\u2026y\u2019know its things like this that sometimes make me question the logic of our glorious leaders.\u201d\n\u201cShhhh! Are you mad? Don\u2019t talk like that! It\u2019s not our place to question anything, we\u2019re just supposed to do our jobs! Besides, the logic is quite obvious. If they train people from birth they\u2019ll have superior combat skills and utter loyalty to the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point though. Is it really necessary? The Empire already produces so much propaganda that it does the job pretty well in producing loyal citizens and if that doesn\u2019t work it also instills so much fear in most that even if someone wanted to start a rebellion; it\u2019s highly unlikely they would.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure, it has happened in the past.\u201d\n\u201cThe past? When? Like four hundred years ago when the Empire was still in its own infancy? Pfft. Wouldn\u2019t happen anymore and as for having elite combat troops, again what\u2019s the point? We\u2019ve already got camps to train elite groups like the Shadow Guard who are not to be fucked with and we have more than enough resources to create an army of golems that would be just as loyal and kick the shit out of our enemies.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore! Our superiors have their reasons, as does the Emperor! Let us just take this baby and be done with this task!\u201d\n\nThe two clerks left the infirmary with you that day where upon you were accepted as a suitable candidate and put into The Eternal Program.\n\nYou don\u2019t remember too much during the time of your very young years, except that you are mostly confined to a room where all your basic needs are met. On a daily basis, a couple bigger people come in to check on you. They have you perform various physical tasks as well as spending time to teach you things like basic reading and writing. Sometimes they ask you various questions and write down your responses while other times they come in and stab you with painful needles with fluid in them. (You don\u2019t like those times)\n\nYou don\u2019t really understand it all, except that you know that the Emperor is always watching you. He is everywhere even if you don\u2019t see him. He is keeping an eye on your actions and you must always obey his will, lest you be punished. You know this to be true because you have this repeatedly told to you.\n\nEventually your relative isolation would come to an end.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years later...", "result": "Year 5\n\nYou are sitting in a gray room at a desk with several other children your age. All of you glance at each other a lot and it is obvious that there is much curiosity, but nobody speaks. This is very unusual for you, up until now, you have only had minimal contact with others. Most of them are male like you, but a few of them are female.\n\nSoon the silence comes to an end when a dark skinned woman walks into the room. She has long hair and sharp features. One thing you notice is that despite her long hair covering her ears you can still see that the tips of them are pointed. She must be elven, but in the pictures you\u2019ve seen in books, you\u2019ve never seen one with dark skin before.\n\n\u201cHello children, and congratulations on maintaining dignified silence during your time by yourselves. It\u2019s nice to see that your previous human minders aren\u2019t totally incompetent. Still, if you were Svelk children you would\u2019ve been much better trained by now. Ah, but it is not my place to dwell on the limitations of the lesser born. I am merely here to oversee your training into proper Eternals so that you may serve the Emperor to your fullest capabilities. Now before we begin, I suggest you all ask questions now, because this will probably be the only time I will be in the mood for your ignorance.\u201d\n\nFor a moment nobody speaks, but when the elven lady insists, one brave soul raises their hand.\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you an elf?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am. While the ignorant would use the vulgar term dark elf to describe me, my kind are more properly known as the Svelk. In fact WE are the purest of the elven race. All others you may have the misfortune of meeting are merely diluted members of our bloodline. They are truly pitiful creatures really only fit for extermination. Remember this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is unimportant, but you and the rest will always address me as Mistress. Failure to do so will earn my wrath, and more importantly the wrath of the Emperor. Remember this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you teach us?\u201d\n\nA second passes after the question, when a small bolt of light from the Svelk\u2019s finger tips and hits the child in the chest asking the question. He falls backwards out of his chair and on to the floor. The rest of you jump in your own chairs and look back at him. He is breathing very erratically.\n\n\u201cI will teach you to OBEY my commands when I give them!\u201d Mistress shouts, she then warns the rest of you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch him, let alone help him! (Sigh) And here I thought you lot had been trained better! It occurs to me that I will have to be extra strict in my discipline. As to the question about what I will teach you\u2026 I will teach you to be warriors. I will teach you to be wizards if you display the talent. I will teach you to shed yourselves of weakness. I will teach you to serve the Emperor without question and kill without mercy and you will always obey for you will find strength in obedience. You will find joy in order. You will find love in murder. You shall be instruments of terror and genocide if he so wishes it. You will be Eternals\u2026or you will die. Remember this.\u201d\n\nAfter Mistress\u2019 speech, the child she struck down eventually struggles back up and gets back in his seat, clutching his chest and still wheezing.\n\n\u201cI trust you have learned your lesson?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2026yes\u2026Mistress\u2026\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cGood, now one more question before we begin\u2026you there. What is your question? Speak up!\u201d Mistress demands while pointing at you, though you have not raised your hand.\n\nYou don\u2019t wish to disagree with Mistress, so you stumble and try to think up a question.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026er\u2026I was just wondering when will you teach us to fight Mistress?\u201d\nMistress raises an eyebrow and gives a smirk as she approaches you.\n\u201cFight? And what makes you think that YOU are even ready to learn yet? Do you have even the slightest knowledge of combat tactics?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mis\u2026\u201d before you can even complete the sentence Mistress knocks you out of your chair with a quick jab with her hand, the pain from your face spreads to your chest when Mistress steps on it with her boot. She digs it into you and presses all her weight on it, while the rest of your class looks on.\n\n\u201cDamn right, no you don\u2019t. You weren\u2019t even alert enough to anticipate my attack. You let me get in close and now look at you, you\u2019re completely at my mercy. I am in a position to do whatever I like with you, while you are only in a position to beg or die. So what will it be worm? Are you going to beg for your miserable life, or should I save the Empire\u2019s time and money by killing you now?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Beg", "result": "The pain is great and you want it to be over with as quickly as possible so you cry out and scream for mercy to Mistress. To this, she merely laughs cruelly and continues to step on your chest.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! If this was a real fight do you think an enemy would should you mercy? You truly are pathetic, how did the Empire ever decide that YOU would be a worthy candidate to be an Eternal? Begging for your wretched life as if it was important. It isn\u2019t. Your life is nothing! ALL of your lives are nothing! Your lives will never be anything more than warm bodies to serve the Emperor! The question is, will you even be able to live up to that honored status? The answer is no, if you do not learn mercy is for the weak. Remember this.\u201d\n\nAt this point Mistress finally takes her foot off of you and much like your other classmate hit by her magic bolt, you slowly get up and back in your seat, clutching your chest. You sniffle and try to keep yourself from crying, but the tears are still there. A glare from Mistress causes you to quickly wipe your eyes and try to compose yourself the best you can.\n\nTime passes by under the harsh guidance of Mistress. She teaches you all that she promised she would and then some. Your lessons are not only that of a combat nature, but of an academic one as well. You wouldn\u2019t be aware of it, but you and your classmates are probably much better educated than other children your age.\n\nAs for you, Mistress never lets you forget of how you begged for your life in front of everyone. While it is true that she sadistically taunts everyone at one time or another, it doesn\u2019t make your emotional and psychological scars go away.\n\nThis shame you experience causes you to become more insecure and you constantly feel the need to prove to everyone that you aren\u2019t weak. When you are called upon to spar with your fellow classmates, you always fight aggressively. For the most part you usually win, and you typically break a few bones of some of your fellow classmates. The lessons of being humiliated by Mistress have not been forgotten. You can\u2019t ever let yourself be put in a vulnerable position again and you must be brutal, it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be able to please the Emperor.\n\nYour personality doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by your instructor and watchers, they make note of it and decide how you should be handled in the next step of your training.\n\nYear 12\n\nYou are in a room with a few of your fellow classmates standing in a row. Most of your class has been separated for reasons unknown to you. All you know right now is there is a scarred orc in worn battle armor arguing with a well dressed man who is human. They are speaking about you, but not actually speaking TO you\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat? I thought the whole point of this program was to create an elite fighting group like the Shadow Guard, why are you splitting them up and intending to put some of them in regular military units?\u201d the orc questions.\n\u201cThings have changed since the program\u2019s inception. Besides, if the latest military reports are any indication I\u2019d say you could use a better quality of recruits, or at least I hope that\u2019s the problem and it isn\u2019t due to a lack of proper training.\u201d the man dressed in black formal wear calmly retorts.\n\u201cHey! I train every grunt I get to be the best killer they can be! I\u2019ve conquered more territory for the Empire than anyone! My record speaks for itself and I could do a hell of a lot more if you put me on the front lines again, so don\u2019t try to tell me I\u2019m not doing my fucking job!\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d say you still could benefit by having a few Eternals in your ranks, if nothing else than to be a good example.\u201d\n\u201cGood example? HAH! We haven\u2019t even seen one of these so-called Eternals in action yet! It\u2019s all been just speculation, and a waste of time and money if you ask me! The Empire should be providing better equipment and more of it, for soldiers on the Rask Frontier, it\u2019s a fucking meat grinder out there and we\u2019re constantly having to put down rebellions by the natives.\u201d\n\u201cWell nobody ASKED you, captain and your problems are not mine to deal with. This is the Emperor\u2019s project and he has his reasons. If I were you I\u2019d watch your tone. Victories or not, you are a servant of the Emperor and you will obey orders or you will be replaced.\u201d\n\nThe orc captain steps back from the well dressed man then he takes a deep breath, before speaking.\n\n\u201cYou are lucky that I do serve the Emperor, for that is the only thing keeping me from ripping out your throat, human\u2026very well I shall take these so called Eternal whelps, but let it be known that I shall be testing them to the limit and then some. If they fail, they shall die like anyone else unable to keep up.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish commander, I leave it in your capable hands. You will keep me apprised of their progress on a weekly basis. Good day.\u201d The well dressed man says and leaves the room, leaving you all alone with the orc commander. You\u2019ve never seen a real orc in person before, but he looks every bit as intimidating from what you\u2019ve read about them, even if he is much more articulate than you expected.\n\nHe walks up and down the row sizing you all up before speaking.\n\n\u201cI am Captain Gruz, and I will be in charge of the rest of your training until the Emperor deems otherwise. I imagine that your former instructor was that dark elven bitch, so I trust you all know by now that failure and weakness have no place here. Correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes Captain!\u201d you all shout in unison.\n\u201cHeh, well glad to see her skills in teaching discipline are still as effective as ever. Good. Now let\u2019s see how good your combat skills are\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point you and your fellow classmates instinctively start to pair up to spar with each other, but Gruz stops you.\n\n\u201cWhat are you lot doing? I didn\u2019t tell you to get out of formation!\u201d\n\u201cBut captain, you said to prove our combat skills.\u201d One boy speaks up.\n\u201cI\u2026oh wait I see. She had you fighting each other. Typical dark elven training. Create mistrust and loathing even when there is no need for it. (Sigh) I can see I\u2019m going to have to undo some of the shit she instilled in you if I\u2019m going to mold you into the proper killing tools.\u201d\n\nTime goes by and Captain Gruz begins to train you in various forms of combat, though it\u2019s different. He teaches you and your classmates to fight as a team. This usually involves various large beasts similar to what you have already fought or even small groups of goblinoids. It takes awhile for you to adapt, but after seeing the first couple of casualties, you and the rest manage to pull together to defeat your enemies.\n\nAcademically speaking, you are not taught much. Captain Gruz figures that Mistress taught you enough math and literacy to get by in life. Besides not much need for all that fancy learnin\u2019 stuff when you\u2019re going to be chopping people\u2019s heads off on the battlefield.\n\nCaptain Gruz is just as uncompromising as Mistress in his training, but he seems less gleeful about it. His verbal abuse is more direct and to the point rather than gloating about your failures. He still reminds you all regularly about how it is your sworn duty to serve the Emperor, but you hardly need him to tell you that, to believe otherwise is unthinkable.\n\nAs for you, you find yourself given a role of leadership. Captain Gruz noted your tendency to be one of the first to charge into battle. He however also has some advice for you.\n\n\u201cI respect your desire for battle, but if you do not control your insecurities you will one day find yourself needlessly unprepared. I suspect that dark elven bitch did something humiliating to you that has resulted in your behavior. Effective in some ways I suppose, but if you truly want to be a leader of men and command respect, you need to master your emotions as you would your weapons. You must do away with insecurities and be fully confident in your abilities. You must walk into battle already KNOWING that you will win, not charging in with a chip on your shoulder with some misguided desire to prove yourself. That\u2019s a quick way to get yourself killed. Contrary to popular belief, your goal is NOT to die for the Emperor. Your goal is to survive and make the other dumb bastards die so that you may continue to serve the Emperor. Think on this when you lead your fellows into your next training assignment.\u201d\n\nThe captain\u2019s words carry much weight with you and in the years during your training you manage to purge most of your doubts about yourself as well as becoming an accomplished warrior.\n\nYour instructor and watchers once again note your growth and skills, and as usual they make decisions on how you will best serve the Emperor.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 16\n\nYou are called into Captain Gruz\u2019s office, when you arrive you see the well dress man that you saw four years ago standing with him\u2026 and debating with him again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you Mr. Mol, I think they should work in the same unit. They\u2019ve trained together and they\u2019ve worked together so well at this point that splitting them up would be folly. Hell, these people have known each other since birth! You know that better than anyone!\u201d Gruz says.\n\u201cYes, captain I\u2019m well aware of the situation, and normally I might agree if their were more of them, but I think their expertise would better serve if we deployed them separately in problem areas of the Empire.\u201d Mr. Mol replies.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t break up a well oiled machine! I guarantee having them all in the same unit will be a better idea. I mean we still haven\u2019t sent them into a real battle yet! Wouldn\u2019t it be better to see if they can get the job done first before placing them in charge of others?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what a perfect opportunity to lose them all, if something unexpected should happen.\u201d\n\u201cOh for\u2026look that could\u2019ve happened here! And if you\u2019re so worried about them all getting killed in battle then what was the fucking point then? Besides, if they do prove to be useless in battle, better we find that out sooner rather than later when they\u2019re in charge of others and getting them killed as well!\u201d\n\nMr. Mol thinks for a moment and then replies.\n\n\u201cHmmm, very well you do have a point captain. We\u2019ll try it your way at first and go from there. Have them deployed in the Nalin province. Your services here have been useful as ever. Good day.\u201d\n\nMr. Mol, steps out and commander Gruz addresses you.\n\n\u201cWell you heard all that, you and your fellow Eternal babies are being sent to the Nalin province. It\u2019s not the Rask Frontier, but it\u2019s a suitable first challenge for you guys. We\u2019ve been trying to settle the conquest of that place for a few years now, and technically it is part of the Empire, but we\u2019re still having problems with the Kobold population there. Little bastards are determined to resist and have been conducting a fairly effective guerilla war since we arrived. Though I blame that more on the incompetence of the commander in that region. If I was stationed there, this shit would\u2019ve been taken care of a long time ago\u2026but I\u2019m not, so unfortunately you will have to report to Captain Pollo.\u201d\n\nCaptain Gruz approaches you closer before continuing.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m putting you in charge of your unit for reasons I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of. While I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve made the right choice, the burden will ultimately be on you to prove to be an effective leader. Remember, you\u2019re not just a normal soldier, you\u2019re supposed to be an Eternal. An instrument of destruction ordered by the Emperor himself. Failure is never an option for you. Even now there are rumors about your kind, and when you finally show yourselves you will be met by fear, awe, hatred and even distain. Prove yourselves and you will live up to the name that your were given. Anyway, the caravan picking you up will arrive tomorrow. Good luck and dismissed.\u201d\n\nWith this you leave and tell the rest of your people about where you\u2019re going and the general nature of what to expect. They all seem pretty excited to prove themselves, and to be honest so are you. At last you will get the chance to prove yourself and can only imagine that the Emperor will be pleased by what he will see.\n\nThe next day, you and your unit are picked up and the ride there is uneventful, but your unit spends a little time talking about things they see on the way. This is the first time all of you have probably been away from the training center you\u2019ve spent all your lives in. Curiosity about some of the surroundings is natural, but it isn\u2019t just the casual talk that\u2019s different.\n\nYour comrades are different. They are less reserved than they once were. Captain Gruz might\u2019ve been a strict instructor, but in addition to encouraging teamwork he was also prone to encourage you guys to have a few hours of free time. This loosening of the reigns a bit, allowed a certain amount of familiarity with each other that wasn\u2019t just on a professional level anymore. Even you have felt yourself changing personality wise.\n\nStill you are all Eternals, and you are loyal to the Emperor. You will never forget that your duty comes first.\n\nEventually you all arrive at Fort Glory in the Nalin province where you are stared at by several soldiers who whisper among themselves. None of you pay it any mind though, you simply report to Captain Pollo. He doesn\u2019t look anything like Captain Gruz. He\u2019s human for one thing and wears lighter armor which is impeccably clean. When he sees you, he almost looks bored, like you were interrupting him, but you when you came in he was reclined in his chair and not doing anything of importance.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you are the Eternals I\u2019ve heard so much about. Humph. I don\u2019t see anything special except that pretty one over there. Oh no, not you dear. That blonde muscular one in the back. Yes, delicious.\u201d Captain Pollo says pointing to one of your men and not even getting out of his chair.\n\n\u201cCaptain Pollo, we are here for our assignments so that we may serve the Emperor.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) I suppose you are this unit\u2019s leader?\u201d\n\u201c Yes, captain. I am currently their leader and holding the rank of sergeant due to my excellence in my training exercises.\u201d\n\u201cSergeant? YOU? Why you\u2019re a mere boy! All of you are just children! I ask them for more men and they send me children! The only thing you all would be good for is cleaning the fort! In fact that\u2019s what you can go do right now, starting with the toilets!\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what Captain Gruz said would happen. This is your first test.\n\n\u201cCaptain, we have been trained in several forms of combat and fully ready to fight. Send us into battle and we will prove ourselves. We are here to perform our duty for the Emperor and all that entails.\u201d\n\u201cAll that entails eh? Okay, you want a fight? A few miles east of here, you\u2019ll find a town called Dalt. Its filled with ignorant peasants that constantly whine to us that there are a nest of kobolds lurking in the hills near them. We\u2019re stretched out as it is and can\u2019t spare anymore troops to waste on towns that are of no military importance in the grand scheme of things. Go there and take care of their problem, then maybe we\u2019ll have more to talk about.\u201d\n\nYou nod and all of you leave, but before you are able to Pollo calls you back.\n\n\u201cOh one more thing sergeant. Order one of your men to stay here with me. I think you know by now which one I mean.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re in genuine shock. You may be young, and even a little detached from normal \u2018society\u201d but you know exactly what Captain Pollo is implying. You can honestly feel more than surprised by this though.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I will need all of my team to have the best chance to succeed in this mission.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Well sorry, but you\u2019ll have to make do like everyone else here does. Or you could clean the fort like I first ordered you to do, which you chose to ignore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a no win situation, though you try to figure out a loophole that takes the responsibility off of you.\n\n\u201cCaptain, you are of a higher rank than me, surely you could just order him yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, nice try. No. You want to be a leader of men? You need to make this decision yourself. Tis quite easy I would think. Sacrifice one for the good of the rest. If anything I\u2019d say he\u2019s the lucky one. He gets to stay here enjoying the pleasures of the flesh, and won\u2019t have to be mucking about with kobolds and dealing with idiotic peasants.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave him behind", "result": "Unfortunately Pollo is right, the only decision that makes sense is to leave Gerald behind.\n\nStill, you aren\u2019t fond of the idea though not necessarily for the moral reasons that most would be. This is an unproductive use of your team\u2019s talents and pointless in the scheme of things. You can\u2019t believe the Empire would allow such a petty man to be in charge of the safety of a province and why isn\u2019t the Emperor aware of such inefficiency?\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d see things my way. Have fun playing with the kobolds. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou leave Pollo\u2019s office where your team is still waiting for you.\n\n\u201cGerald, I regret that you will not be coming with us on this mission. The Captain wants you to stay with him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat?! But I\u2019m ready to fight!\u201d he protests.\n\u201cThere will be other missions, I promise you. We will prove ourselves so well on this one, that they will have no choice but to send us out on a regular basis. However, your orders are clear in this matter, you are to remain here with Captain Pollo.\u201d\n\u201cB\u2026yes sir.\u201d\n\nJust before Gerald goes into the captain\u2019s office, you whisper into his ear.\n\n\u201cAccidents happen.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a little puzzled by this comment, but you and the rest of your team proceed to your assignment and nobody says anything more about it.\n\nWhen you finally get to the town, it\u2019s a sorry sight. A lot of the buildings are damaged and the streets are filled with debris. There are a few people attempting to clean up the place, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re all very demoralized.\n\n\u2018Oh, I see the Empire has finally decided to help us; well you\u2019re too late! The kobolds raided this town last night and as you can see completely trashed the place!\u201d says a disheveled man.\n\u201cThe Empire has many places it has to protect citizen. It is regrettable that your town was attacked, but we are here now to eliminate the problem.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now? Where the fuck were you last night when my wife was killed by those ugly little bastards?\u201d the man says getting in your face.\n\u201cCalm yourself citizen, this will not help your situation.\u201d\n\u201cMy situation? I just said my wife is fucking DEAD! I don\u2019t give a shit about my situation anymore you fucking Empire dickhead! Fuck you and your fucking Emperor!\u201d\n\nIt is at this point the man unwisely pushes your chest with his hand and you instantly grab it and break his whole arm. He predictably crumples in excruciating pain, screaming as the bone juts out of the skin and blood runs out of his body into the mud. All the other towns people who have seen this back off or hide, as they are rightfully worried about what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\n\u201cNow listen up citizens of Dalt! I understand that you\u2019ve all been through a lot, but that is not a reason to give in to insolence! You are all Empire subjects and you will show proper respect or what\u2019s left of this town will suffer in such a manner that you\u2019ll think what the kobolds did was a birthday party.\u201d\n\nThe man whose arm you broke begins to scream more obscenities at you in between his regular howls of pain. You look at Kane and nod. Kane finishes the man off by quickly decapitating him. You take his head and throw it before one of the crowd of peasants who look on in horror.\n\n\u201cRemember this.\u201d You say.\n\nYou remain in the town of Dalt for the night and get rooms from an overly cooperative innkeeper. He also tells you a little information about the kobolds such what direction they came from, what sort of equipment they were using and how many there were during the attack. Before getting some rest you spend a little of the time discussing strategy with your team. You all don\u2019t show it too much, but you are all a little excited about tomorrow.\n\nThe next day you set off towards the wooded hills, it doesn\u2019t take long before you see a kobold patrol wandering around. They look exactly like how you\u2019ve seen them in books, sort of like scaly goblins, but from what you\u2019ve heard, a lot more cunning.\n\nYour team attempts to be stealthy, but perhaps it\u2019s due to the excitement of this first \u201creal\u201d battle. Edgar isn\u2019t as silent as he should be and clumsily steps on a few twigs alerting the patrols.\n\nThe kobold patrol sees all of you, yell excitedly in their language and run away. Edgar is about to chase them, but you knock him to the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he says wondering why you stopped him.\n\u201cTrap, Edgar. Look.\u201d You say and point to a tripwire that would\u2019ve triggered a spiked log that he almost stepped on.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He says.\n\u201cYou were trained better than that Edgar and we went over this last night! This area is probably going to be filled with traps. Now come on, we don\u2019t have the luxury of a surprise attack any more.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of this attack is a tedious exercise in cautiousness broken up by quick battles. The kobolds really have set up traps everywhere and take full advantage of your team\u2019s slow movement to launch periodic ambushes themselves. Fortunately they are very poor warriors even in large numbers and you easily dispatch them. All your fighting eventually leads to a cave, which you sort of figured it would. You warn your team that this place is probably going to be a maze and heavily trapped as well.\n\n\u201cShould we split up so we can cover more ground?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re going to be neck deep in them when we go into that cave. They may be poor warriors, but even enough of them could overwhelm one or two of us. If we stick together we\u2019ll be fine. Besides, we\u2019re going to be here awhile anyway.\u201d\n\nThere \u201cawhile\u201d isn\u2019t an exaggeration. You spend the remainder of the day and night killing kobolds. Your team seems to enjoy it, but you eventually start to get bored of the monotony. You don\u2019t even bat an eye when you come across what seems to be a breeding chamber and you exterminate all the female kobolds and their young. Eventually you reach a large cave clearing where you meet the leader.\n\n\u201cSssss! Defilersss! Murderersss!\u201d a slightly larger kobold hisses at you from some sort of primitive throne and then orders his guards to attack. It\u2019s rather pathetic, as they fare no better than the rest. A few quick sword and axe blows and this kobold chieftain is alone.\n\nWhile the rest of your team is eager to kill him like the rest, you have a slightly better idea for him. You engage him in singles combat, which is over pretty quickly. You then subdue him with some rope you have in your pack.\n\n\u201cWhy are we taking him as prisoner? We\u2019re Eternals! We don\u2019t take prisoners!\u201d Edgar shouts.\n\u201cYeah, we also aren\u2019t supposed to miss obviously placed traps either, so there\u2019s a first time for everything. Besides I\u2019ve got a good idea for this one.\u201d\n\nYou drag the kobold leader back to town who curses you the whole time in a mixture of his language and yours. When you arrive it is now dawn and the townspeople are surprised to see you back, let alone with a kobold in tow.\n\nYou tie the kobold leader to a tree near the center of the town and address everyone.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Dalt! The kobold nest has been completely destroyed. This\u2026thing was the leader of this particular nest and most likely orchestrated the raid; do with him as you will. There of course are other kobold nests in this province, but the Eternals will be taking care of this long overdue problem. All the Empire needs in this matter is your continued obedience and loyalty.\u201d\n\nAfter giving this speech you and your team take your leave and hear the screams of the kobold leader as the villagers torture and rip him apart.\n\nWhen you arrive back at Fort Glory, other soldiers are surprised to see all of you back alive. It was assumed that at best, half of you would be dead. There is a possible thought of whether you actually succeeded and didn\u2019t just come back in failure, but given that Kane took it upon himself to take \u201ctrophies\u201d his gruesome necklace of kobold ears makes it pretty clear that the job was done.\n\nWhen you report however, it seems the fort has undergone a change in leadership\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Lieutenant Anu and now in charge of Fort Glory until further notice. First things first, did you accomplish your mission?\n\u201cMission accomplished, we killed them all lieutenant. All of their warriors, all of their women, all of their babies, pets, their leader, all of them.\u201d\n\u201cWell always helps to be sure. Which brings me to the next point. Your man Gerald is currently in the stockade. In fact he may be facing execution.\u201d\n\u201cMight I inquire why, sir?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019d probably know as much about it as I do, but if I had to guess? Captain pervert put the moves on him and your man took exception to it and killed him. He claims it was an accident, but there\u2019s no way the captain twisted his own head ALL THE WAY AROUND just by tripping and falling over.\u201d\n\u201cIf Gerald says it was an accident, then I believe him sir.\u201d\n\u201cOkay look, I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that the captain wasn\u2019t complete scum. I should know I had to serve along side him for the past five years. I saw how he\u2019d have teenage boys brought to his office. Now I know you guys are these Eternals that we\u2019ve all heard about, but dammit man, we can\u2019t just have murders within the ranks, we have to respect some sort of order here!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about respecting order sir\u2026I suppose if it is absolutely necessary to execute Gerald, then that will be regrettable. I would however say that Gerald\u2019s actions actually contributed to more order here and will better for the Empire in general.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThe removal of captain Pollo, has allowed you to move up in rank and judging by your feelings on this matter you are a person who respects military decorum. I have no doubt, the fort will be run more efficiently now.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Anu chuckles a bit. \u201cI\u2019d almost think you were trying to butter me up to save your guy, but I already know you genuinely believe what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019re right anyway. (Sigh) Well\u2026I suppose accidents do happen. Nobody here is going to miss Pollo, so I\u2019ll have Gerald released and write up a report.\u201d\n\u201cSir, can I make a request?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re pushing your luck?\u201d\n\u201cNot my intention sir, but I was going to ask if there\u2019s anything my group could do here that\u2019s a little more challenging than killing kobolds?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes I imagine you would feel that way...well on the furthest southern edge of the province there have been bands of nomadic raiders and there have been rumors of them organizing under some sort of shaman. Dunno if it\u2019s true or not. Of course we could also transfer you someplace where the battle is a little more suited to your violence level.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Request transfer", "result": "You don\u2019t see much point in staying in this place anymore, you would most likely serve the Empire better elsewhere. Captain Anu grants the request, though he mentions he knows that a Mr. Mol is taking interest in your progress here, so it\u2019ll have to go through him first.\n\nA couple days pass and it is all straightened out. Mr. Mol approves, but he goes with his original plan of separating you all. Brenda and Gerald remain in the Nalin province, Roldan and Warrick go to the Felkan border. You, Kane and Edgar all wind up at the Rask frontier, specifically Fort Defiance. The split is a little odd for all of you, considering you\u2019ve all been together so long.\n\nYou say your goodbyes to Brenda and Gerald first when the caravan comes for you. Next you say your goodbyes to Warrick and Roldan when they make their stop. The remainder of the trip is in relative silence, though sometimes Edgar remarks about how he can\u2019t wait to display his true combat skills against better challenges.\n\nEventually you arrive at the Rask frontier and make your stop at Fort Defiance. You haven\u2019t gotten off the caravan five minutes when a man wearing battle armor approaches you.\n\n\u201cHey are you the Eternals?\u201d\n\u201cYes we are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Captain Ian, I\u2019ve heard about you and while you don\u2019t look like much, we\u2019ll take anyone at this point. Though I would\u2019ve preferred more battle mages or even orcs at this point.\n\nCaptain Ian begins to give you a run down on the entire area. He mentions that the mortality rate here is high so morale isn\u2019t the best. He goes on to mention that Shadow Guard detachments have been assigned here to help out, but between the ogres and the giants there\u2019s only so much that even they can do. He mentions since you three have already worked together he\u2019s just going to leave you together, but will be assigning you to a new unit where you will have others to command as well.\n\nWith the caravan leaving, the three of you head to your new unit. When you see them, quite a few of them are predictably much older than you, but surprisingly you see that half of them are around your age.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re those Eternals huh?\u201d one the older soldiers says almost dismissively.\n\u201cYes? Did you need something corporal?\u201d you say sensing the hostility.\n\u201cNothing, sergeant. I just wondered if you were.\u201d He says backing down from confrontation.\n\nThe three of you settle in as you begin your assignment at Fort Defiance.\n\nYear 18\n\n\u201cKane watch out!\u201d you shout as the wind whips around you and the snowfall nearly blinds your vision.\n\nYou can just make out the figure, which you know to be Kane roll out of the way of a club strike from an ogre attempting to attack him from behind.\n\nYou look around and see the bloody dead bodies of several members of your team and the ogres that ambushed you. You knew that patrolling the Kragen Pass during a blizzard was a stupid idea, but Captain Ian insisted that you had to go and do it. It\u2019s no wonder progress hasn\u2019t been made up here with the captain making inept decisions at every turn. He\u2019s not like Captain Pollo, but he\u2019s not much better. You are starting to seriously wonder about how the Empire keeps allowing such incompetence to pass through.\n\nYou run as fast as you can in the snow to help Kane battle the last two ogres. You cleave at the legs of one of the large monsters causing him to fall into the snow then finish him off with another strike through his head. Kane dispatches his own ogre opponent and the battle is finally over.\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re the only two left again.\u201d Kane says.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting used to that scenario. Come on, let\u2019s head back. This blizzard isn\u2019t letting up and we\u2019ve done all we can here.\u201d\n\nYou and Kane leave behind the bodies and make your way through the blizzard in silence. It\u2019s times like this you half expect Edgar to start going on about how well he did in battle, of course he hasn\u2019t done that ever since you lost him in that battle against some giants last year. You never exactly approved of his reckless ways and it\u2019s ultimately what got him killed, but you still miss him sometimes.\n\nYou are almost at the end of the pass when a large rumbling is heard. You look overhead and even in this blizzard you can see the large figures looming on the cliffs and it\u2019s what you originally were concerned about when you had to patrol this path.\n\n\u201cGIANTS! RUN!\u201d you yell and the pair of you attempt to make it out of the pass. Large boulders crash down along side the cliffs with an equally large amount of ice and snow. Kane runs faster and makes it ahead of you, but this only results in you seeing him crushed completely by a falling boulder. You are engulfed in snow and swept up and buried in the stuff. You\u2019re disorientated, tired, freezing and slowly suffocating, but with determination, you manage to dig yourself out.\n\nUnfortunately several giants face you when you do dig yourself out. You\u2019re out numbered and trapped in the pass. You know that this is most likely going to be your last battle.\n\nYou draw your sword and walk towards the giants. It will be a good death, but your only regret is that you will not survive to serve the Empire for longer than you would\u2019ve liked.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Face the raiders", "result": "You decide that it might be wise to maintain a presence here, after all there is still work to be done and you\u2019re confident that things will be better at the fort now. Lieutenant Anu nods and says you can set out in a couple days to the town of Jekka. He mentions that the nomads have never been a problem like the kobold are, but lately they have been reaching that level. He also says they aren\u2019t native to Nalin, but rather the desert land south of it.\n\nYou spend the next couple of days at the fort are spent honing your weapon skills and telling your team to do likewise. Gerald joins you after being released from the stockade. He looks a little embarrassed and you reprimand him for his lack of finesse, but welcome him back.\n\nEventually you set off for the southern Nalin border. The journey isn\u2019t as uneventful as the first mission and you encounter a few kobolds attacking travelers along the roads. You easily dispatch them of course.\n\nThe town of Jekka is in much better shape than Dalt, but its obvious the people here have been suffering from attacks.\n\n\u201cEmpire soldiers? Here? I thought you lot were chasing down kobolds to waste time with the likes of us.\u201d A man says to you. He looks to be some sort of town sheriff.\n\u201cAll Empire towns are under our protection citizen. We have heard this one is suffering heavy raids from the desert nomads.\u201d\n\u201c Well, we\u2019ve been doing okay so far, but a few of the other border villages have gotten it pretty bad. One of them was totally destroyed. Those lizard riders have never been this bad or numerous before. The weird thing is, they just destroy and kill, they don\u2019t actually do any proper raiding or looting, not that it really matters. but for the past few months.\u201d\n\u201cWe heard rumors of a shaman uniting them.\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s the rumor, but really nobody knows what\u2019s going on with them. They make quick attacks and then run back to their accursed desert. So when are more Empire soldiers coming?\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! We\u2019ve been holding out for months with no hope in sight and now that you give us a little bit, you take it away again?\u201d\n\u201cCitizen, I advise you to calm yourself.\u201d You warn, wondering if you\u2019re going to have to make another point like you did in Dalt. You don\u2019t since thought since the sheriff has more sense.\n\u201cAlright, alright, but I\u2019m telling you there are a lot of those lizard riders! I hope you\u2019re more than just regular Empire soldiers. You guys Shadow Guard or something?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re Eternals.\u201d\n\nYou set up your staging point in Jekka. The desert raiders will probably attack this town again as usual, so you might as well take advantage of the fact. The waiting is tedious, but eventually after few days it pays off.\n\nSeveral of the raiders appear in the distance and make no hesitation in their attack. The raiders are trying to rely on intimidation, because they sure aren\u2019t relying on strategy and only attack the town from one direction. The lizard creatures that the raiders ride might be intimidating to the average citizen, but you\u2019ve fought bigger creatures during training. They\u2019re rather clumsy beasts actually and when you and your team begin to use your own hit and run tactics, they start to collide into each other causing problems for the raiders.\n\nAs for the raiders themselves, they prove to be barely better fighters than the kobolds after dismounting several of them. Underneath the desert protection gear they wear, they don\u2019t appear to be human or any other race you\u2019re familiar with, but they bleed just like all them and that\u2019s the important thing.\n\nAs many battles often go, this one is over quicker than it felt. The remaining raiders run off and you order your people to mount up and chase them down which is fairly easy to do.\n\nJekka suffered some damage and a few dead, but overall the townspeople couldn\u2019t be happier with the outcome and most shower you with praise. However, you get the impression that you\u2019re going to be facing more of these raiders in the near future and you\u2019re right.\n\nA couple days pass and another raid on the town of Jekka occurs in the same exact manner, then again a few days after that. A week passes and there are no more raids, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve stopped. You already know they\u2019ve been attacking several settlements, so you tell Warrick and Roldan to scout out the closest ones to see what their situation is while you try to build some proper defenses for Jekka.\n\nA week passes and you learn more about your foes from a villager who survived the destruction of his home. The desert raiders (or the Usksha as you\u2019ve come to find out their proper name) have indeed been united under one banner by a shaman of some sort. The villager says he saw this being with his own eyes and was spared for the sole purpose to warn all that the Usksha will no longer tolerate a foreign presence encroaching on their desert. This shaman said he has been chosen personally by their god Usk to destroy all those that do and that the town of Jekka will not be able to resist the inevitable destiny that it will fall.\n\n\u201cSo, he\u2019s coming here then? Good, saves us the trouble of hunting him down.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cCombined with this information and based on what Warrick and I have scouted out, it sounds like there will be even more of them. Possibly a full blown army. We might need reinforcements from Fort Glory.\u201d Roldan says.\n\u201cReinforcements? Hah! We\u2019ve beaten them several times with ease!\u201d\n\u201cWould they even get here in time? We don\u2019t exactly know when the attack will come.\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cThey might or they might not, still we should try. Find out who the best runner is in this town and have them travel to Fort Glory with this news. We can continue to prepare in the meantime.\u201d You say.\n\nThe next morning several Uskshas appear in the distance like the other times you fought them. Then more show up, then even more. The town sheriff completely panics and says he\u2019s never seen this many before. This of course causes most of the other townies to panic as well. You slap him and tell him if he and anyone else aren\u2019t going to be helpful then they need to stay out of the way and find someplace to hide.\n\nThey come at you screaming and yelling in their barbarian language and suddenly a huge worm thing comes out of the ground in the center of town.\n\n\u201cHa ha! At last a real fight!\u201d Edgar yells and runs at it immediately as it destroys the nearby tavern. You order Kane to come with you to help Edgar while the rest try to delay the rest of the usksha. You just hope the barricades hold up long enough for them to greatly whittle the numbers down.\n\nYou, Edgar and Kane approach the great worm, which bashes its great body into the side of another building, killing many townspeople hiding inside.\n\n\u201cYOU! You think you can destroy me? I am an avatar of Usk! How can you destroy a god when you are, but a mere child of a corrupt empire?\u201d you suddenly hear in your mind.\n\nIt takes a split moment, but you realize that this beast is the shaman. He has used magic of some kind to transform himself into this thing. It doesn\u2019t matter how much favor he has from his god though, he isn\u2019t one and will die like the rest.\n\nUsing his daggers like climbing gear, Kane jumps as high as he can and sink them into the shaman, while you and Edgar attempt to chop at his body like it was a tree. The shaman roars and attempts to smash you with his body, but you pull Edgar out of the way and Kane jumps off before being crushed. The shaman burrows back into the hole he came from and a few moments later he breaks through in another area of the town and begins destroying the barricades. You reach the shaman just in time for him to sink back into his hole again, while usksha pour in through the broken wall.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Edgar shouts in exasperation.\n\u201cPlug up that opening with their dead bodies!\u201d you shout as you chop off the head of one their lizards before doing the same to the fallen rider.\n\nHolding the back the tide of usksha isn\u2019t exactly what you want to be doing though, you want to take down that shaman, do that and this battle is over.\n\nWhen you hear him break through the ground again elsewhere in town, you tell Kane and Edgar to hold the line here, while you go see if you can get him.\n\nYou see him near the center of town again trying to finish destroying the buildings there. You chop down a few usksha near him and resume attempting to bring him down. He uses his crushing attack like last time, but this time you anticipate and not only dodge, but you manage to run your sword into his eye when his head is at your level. He bellows in pain and attempts to escape again, but you won\u2019t let go of your sword and pull it towards you as he pulls backwards. You fall to the ground as the sword finishes slicing through the shaman\u2019s flesh leaving a gapping wound where his eye and part of his \u201cface\u201d would be.\n\nYou then see the worm collapse to the ground and begin to glow. Some of the others nearby, human and usksha alike stop fighting to stand and watch in wonder. The shaman transforms back into his natural form, his head and body displaying heavy wounds.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026can\u2019t\u2026you\u2026why\u2026we hate you\u2026you aren\u2019t\u2026wanted\u2026your empire will die\u2026we will reclaim what is oursss\u2026\u201d are the scattered words you hear in your head as you approach the shaman\u2019s broken body.\n\u201cStop talking.\u201d You say and run your sword through his other eye.\n\nIt is at this point you hear the howls of several usksha as their mental link with their leader has been severed. You, your team and even a few vengeful townspeople butcher the remaining usksha that don\u2019t get away while attempting to retreat.\n\nJekka is half in ruins and many are dead, but the battle has been won.\n\nThe following day a detachment of troops arrive from Fort Glory. They look at the carnage and the platoon leader reports to you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Corporal Delan and I\u2019m here to help you with\u2026shit, what the hell happened here?\u201d\n\u201cVictory, corporal. Victory.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo\u2026the threat is gone?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gone, but it won\u2019t be rearing its head for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cI say we should march into that desert and wipe them out permanently, then we\u2019d never have to worry about them ever again!\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cWell, if you decide to do that, we\u2019ll help. I know you\u2019ve been busy down here so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but we\u2019ve made great strides in eliminating the kobolds, so Captian Anu told us to help you with this problem as much as we can.", "action_results": [{"action": "March into the desert", "result": "The usksha are broken and on the run, the opportunity to eliminate them as a future threat is certainly there, along with extending the Empire\u2019s influence south of the Nalin province. Your recent victories have filled you with confidence and you agree you should mount an attack on the usksha.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! Look I know you guys are Eternals, and I won\u2019t deny that you\u2019re the best warriors I\u2019ve ever seen, but even you won\u2019t be able to conquer the usksha in their desert! They\u2019ve lived there for centuries, even before the Empire existed! They know it like nobody else, you\u2019ll be outnumbered and fighting the elements themselves!\u201d the Jekka sheriff exclaims. Somehow he survived the battle by hiding no doubt.\n\nPerhaps he is content on being a coward all his life, but you were meant for much more! You are an Eternal and the Emperor himself will reward you himself when you make the first steps in civilizing the desert. You slap him again and tell him that you\u2019ll need as much water as everyone can carry.\n\nAfter a period of rest, you, your team and Delan\u2019s men set off for the desert. You figure the best way to approach this is to follow the usksha\u2019s tracks. This works out well at first as the lizard mounts are heavy footed creatures that leave deep prints, so you come across several small bands of fleeing usksha.\n\nWhen you begin to leave the Nalin province and enter the desert, the prints get harder to track. You follow tracks for two days before you find more usksha. Still, you aren\u2019t finding any large settlements.\n\nBy day four and Delan\u2019s men are starting to complain. He tries to maintain order, but it\u2019s obvious they can\u2019t take the heat of the day and cold of the night. Your own team is fairing better, but even a couple of them are starting to make comments.\n\nOn the seventh night, you\u2019re ambushed by several usksha who spring up from the sands itself; they manage to kill several of Delan\u2019s men before you dispatch them.\n\n\u201cSergeant, I think we need to get the hell out of this desert. There\u2019s nothing here, but sand and death!\u201d\n\u201cThen leave weakling! We\u2019re more than able to carry out this mission ourselves! We don\u2019t need anybody! We\u2019re Eternals!\u201d Edgar shouts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt our abilities sir, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this isn\u2019t a waste of time. We\u2019ve defeated the usksha and chased them deep into their own land. Maybe we\u2019ve made our point.\u201d Roldan says.\n\u201cI\u2019m finding myself agreeing sir, we could better serve the Empire elsewhere.\u201d Gerald adds.\n\n\u201cDuly noted. We\u2019re sticking with the original plan and as for you Delan, you\u2019re under my command too, so you aren\u2019t going anywhere either, now I advise you to find your guts and keep what men you have left in line, before I take away what little authority you still have left.\u201d\n\nCorporal Delan obeys and silently slinks back to his men. Your own people obey as well, but you know that the voices of dissent are already there. Still, you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019ll find something of importance out here along with wiping out usksha.\n\nOn day ten, a strange reptilian creature attacks you. The first instinct is to defend yourself of course, but when it turns Warrick and Gerald to stone instantly, even you find yourself worried.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at it! It\u2019s got some sort of magic attack!\u201d you shout and put your shield to cover yourself.\n\nDelan and his couple remaining men don\u2019t even stick around they turn and run completely. Edgar closes his eyes and swings wildly at the beast, but only manages to get himself mauled by the creature\u2019s sharp teeth and claws. The distraction is enough for Brenda to shoot several arrows in the beast while its back is to her. The beast gives a final bellow and dies.\n\nYou survey the damage and it\u2019s pretty bad. You\u2019ve lost two men, and looking at Edgar on the ground it\u2019ll soon be three. He can\u2019t even form any words, he just looks up at the sky gurgling and spitting up blood and trying to clutch at an arm which is no longer there.\n\n\u201cI told you! I told you we should\u2019ve gone back!\u201d Roldan screams.\n\u201cSilence! I\u2019m in charge here and you won\u2019t speak to me like that again!\u201d you say.\n\u201cSomebody needs to tell you something, because\u2026\u201d\n\nYou lose your patience from a combination of the disrespect, the loss, the failure, the heat, all of it. You punch Roldan causing him to fall to the ground. He looks up in disbelief at first, but then begins to laugh.\n\n\u201cHa ha\u2026ha ha ha ha ha! We\u2026ha ha ha! Found more usksha!\u201d he laughs and points. You all turn to see a sizable group of mounted usksha in the distance. They don\u2019t move in either, instead they shoot at you with their bows.\n\nBrenda catches an arrow to her leg before you can sound a retreat. You and Kane run, but Roldan just sits there still laughing, the next time you turn your head to look back, he\u2019s no longer sitting up. Brenda tries to keep up, but the arrow in her leg slows her down and eventually she catches two more arrows in her back, killing her much in the same way she killed that strange beast.\n\nEventually you and Kane get away, but in all the excitement you don\u2019t know where you are and you don\u2019t even have the tracks you were following to go back to. Under better and less stressful conditions you might get your bearings again, but you never do.\n\nYour next few days involve wandering the desert being continually worn down by usksha ambushes and the sun. You leave Kane\u2019s dehydrated body and continue alone, but not for long as you eventually also succumb to the heat.\n\nAs you lay dying your thoughts of glory are gone and though dehydrated, you manage to shed a single tear for your failure to serve the Emperor.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Leave it alone", "result": "Marching into the desert without a grand plan other than simple slaughter isn\u2019t much of a plan. The usksha are nomads anyway, you\u2019d never be able to catch all of them in their home turf.\n\n\u201cNo, I believe we\u2019ve taken care of the major problem, but I think you should stay here and oversee the safety of this town now. We\u2019ll head back to Fort Glory and report the situation.\u201d You tell Delan.\n\nAs you pack up and start to leave, Edgar begins to complain.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing? We should be trying to hunt down the rest of the usksha!\u201d\n\u201cOur mission here is done, the usksha have been defeated. If we get ordered to mount an expedition into the desert then we shall do so.\u201d\n\u201cBah! Anu is probably going to assign us to fight kobolds again! We should be taking the initiative!\u201d\n\u201cIt seems every time you take the initiative, I end up having to help you in some way. I\u2019d recommend that you worry less about fighting and more about your combat techniques.\u201d\n\nAt this point Edgar gets noticeably mad, but says nothing and walks off. You\u2019re starting to get slightly concerned about him. You\u2019d rather not have to teach him a lesson like you did when you were still training under Mistress.\n\nWhen you arrive at Fort Glory and report to Captain Anu he\u2019s pleased with what you\u2019ve accomplished and is impressed. He says he\u2019d like to keep you here to finish up wiping out the kobold infestation, but he\u2019s received word from the top that your team is to be transferred elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going sir?\u201d\n\u201cThe Rask frontier and I don\u2019t mind saying I don\u2019t envy you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of the place before. What is the situation there?\u201d\n\u201cBad, worse and downright horrible. As far as I know the Empire has been trying to establish order there for decades and not making any progress.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, I certainly hope you don\u2019t make it a habit of saying disparaging things about the Empire.\u201d A man says walking into the room. It\u2019s Mr. Mol.\n\u201cUh no sir. Sorry sir.\u201d Captain Anu says sheepishly.\n\nMr. Mol overlooks his comments and speaks to you directly.\n\n\u201cIgnore the captain\u2019s words, everyone exaggerates the situation at the Rask frontier. While the area is having some problems, the fact remains if it really was so bad there, we would\u2019ve pulled out a long time ago. Anyway, congratulations on your latest mission. Couldn\u2019t help overhearing your report in the next room, quite impressive. Which makes me believe it was a good idea to transfer you now.\u201d\n\u201cThe Eternals are ready to serve the Emperor wherever he may need us sir.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd the Emperor will always appreciate your service. He has been watching you, you know. He always is. That is why he believes you would be most effective apart from each other.\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cYou are Eternals, m\u2019boy. You were bred to lead as well as fight. You\u2019ve already proven yourself to be able to do both, but your fellow Eternals will never reach their fullest potential if they live under your shadow. All of you will be separated and given your own commands in territories the Emperor needs you the most. I have no doubt you all will be successful and honor the Emperor with your future victories.\u201d\n\u201cW..we will sir, but you said territories. Are we not all being sent to the Rask frontier?\u201d\n\u201cOh I think the captain misunderstood. A few of you are being sent there, but some of you are staying here, and others are yet being sent elsewhere. Here, here\u2019s your orders, you can inform the rest of your team, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be excited to hear this news too, oh and consider yourself promoted to lieutenant. The rest of your team members will probably be promoted to sergeant rank when they officially get their assignments. I think that\u2019s about it. A caravan will be here to transfer some of you to your new assignments in a few days. Good day.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Mol goes walking out the office, you feel a little strange. Your team has been together so long, it feels weird to know that you\u2019re going to be split apart.\n\n\u201cSorry for the wrong information, I thought all of you would be sent to the Rask frontier. Well I guess I\u2019m glad to know some of your are staying, heh\u2026are you okay?\u201d Captain Anu asks.\n\u201cHuh? Oh yes. I\u2019m okay captain. If you\u2019ll excuse me I have to inform my team of their new assignments.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly. Dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou inform your team of the news and there is a mixture of feelings. There is some excitement of gaining their own commands, but are still a little apprehensive about splitting up. Well all of them except Edgar who seems to be solely overjoyed that he\u2019s getting his own command.\n\n\u201cOkay, Roldan and Brenda, you\u2019re staying here.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, I was hoping I\u2019d at least get to go some place different.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cMake no mistake, this area still needs order established. I believe you and Roldan will do a fine job in continuing the reputation of excellence that we have built here.\u201d\n\nYou continue with the list.\n\n\u201cGerald and Warrick, you\u2019re being assigned along the Felkan border. Apparently the non-aggression treaty the Empire had with the Felkan Kingdom has expired and tensions have been high. War with them may even break out.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting. Well if war does break out, we\u2019ll be the first one to show the Felkans the error of defying the Emperor\u2019s mercy.\u201d Warrick says.\n\u201cYeah, yeah! Let\u2019s get on with it, where am I going?\u201d Edgar interrupts.\n\nYou glare at Edgar and then continue.\n\n\u201cYou, Kane and I are all being sent to the Rask frontier.\u201d\n\u201cAs it should be. My skills were going to waste here.\u201d\n\u201cEdgar, I\u2019m going to say this while I\u2019m still your superior. I certainly hope you realize that this isn\u2019t a game and you\u2019ll prove yourself to be a competent leader.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m just as much of a leader as you are! The difference is I take risks and that will be a trait that will necessary in a place like the Rask frontier! I will rise up in the ranks and bring honor to the name Eternal and glory to the Emperor!\u201d\n\u201cYou mean glory to yourself because you feel like you have something to prove.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t? You\u2019re a hypocrite anyway! Always were ever since we trained under Mistress! I still recall you begging for your life to her as she crushed you under her boot. From that day on you were always trying to prove yourself and beating the bloody pulp out everyone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as I recall you were on that end several times Edgar. Is that why you\u2019re still trying to prove yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYou wanna try that now?\u201d Edgar says getting in your face and at this point all of your fellow Eternals intervene to break up a potential fight.\n\n\u201cHey come on you guys! We can\u2019t be seen fighting each other like this! We\u2019re Eternals, we put all that stuff behind us back in training. We\u2019re professionals and supposed to be setting the example for the Empire!\u201d Roldan says.\n\nEdgar brushes himself and backs off.\n\n\u201cTell you what Roldan. You set the example for the Empire. All of you set the example. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be scoring victories and actually serving the Emperor by conquering land in his name.\u201d\n\nAnd with these last words, he takes his leave all of you.\n\nThe last few days together are a little awkward with what transpired between you and Edgar. Still you say your goodbyes to Roldan and Brenda when the caravan comes.\n\nA few days after that, you then say your goodbyes to Warrick and Gerald.\n\nYou, Edgar and Kane sit in silence for the remainder of the trip. Eventually you arrive at the Rask frontier and make your stop at Fort Destiny. You haven\u2019t gotten off the caravan five minutes when a woman wearing battle armor approaches you.\n\n\u201cHey are you the Eternals?\u201d\n\u201cYes we are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Captain Krozer, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you and wanted to meet you personally. Welcome to hell.\u201d\n\nCaptain Krozer begins to give you a run down on the entire area. She mentions that the mortality rate here is high so morale isn\u2019t the best, but she hopes that you and the other Eternals assigned here can rally some sort hope here again.\n\nCaptain Krozer also goes on to tell you that there\u2019s been a slight change of plans in your assignments. She says that you\u2019re still staying here, but that Kane and Edgar are going to Fort Defiance, which is further north. Probably for the best considering what transpired between you and Edgar.\n\nKane nods a dignified goodbye to you, and gets back on the caravan; Edgar of course isn\u2019t as pleasant and gives you a hostile glare before leaving.\n\nWith the caravan leaving, you head to your new unit. When you see them, quite a few of them are predictably much older than you, but surprisingly you see that half of them are around your age.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re one those Eternals huh?\u201d one the older soldiers says almost dismissively. You\u2019re in no mood to warn anyone this time, so you go straight to the point and throw him to the floor with his arm painfully twisted behind his back.\n\u201cCorrect, and you\u2019ll address me as sir or lieutenant if you want to keep this arm, because it\u2019ll be very hard to continue doing your duty for the Emperor with just a stump. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cArgh. Y..yes sir!\u201d\n\nAnd so begins your assignment in the Rask frontier.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Chapter 2A: For The Empire!\n\n\n\nYear 20\n\n\u201cWatch it the last ones are coming from the left side!\u201d you shout, pointing at the barbarian wolfmen breaking through the barricade.\n\nTwo of your number go down before the might of the wolfmen. As always you find yourself having to do things yourself. Not that you\u2019re adverse to placing yourself in the thick of battle, but sometimes you get a little tired of having to micromanage.\n\nOne of the wolfmen goes down by your blade with ease, the other three however are shot full of bolts, though you were very nearly in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cDAMMIT, watch where you\u2019re shooting!\u201d You shout at the dark elven mercenaries.\n\u201cOh stop being so dramatic, we\u2019ve been shooting with these crossbows longer than you\u2019ve even been alive I\u2019d wager.\u201d One of them replies, followed by a few snickers.\n\nYou shake your head at the fact that you have to routinely work with them, let alone having to put up with their kind. Then again you\u2019ve had to put up with a lot around here for the past four years.\n\n\u201cAre we done fighting these dogs now? When are we going to get back to killing more sveld? That\u2019s a lot more fun.\u201d One of the mercenaries says.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t getting paid to have fun svelk! You\u2019re getting paid to do your job. If you really want to go murder your tree loving cousins so bad, we\u2019re not stopping you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhatever monkey, our job here is done, we\u2019re heading back. Let us know when you need our help again.\u201d The mercenary says and they leave.\n\nYou survey the damage to the logging camp and it\u2019s going to be awhile before this place is up and running to it\u2019s full capabilities again. Still, today is a victory and despite everything, you\u2019ve managed to eliminate more enemies even if it does seem like they are everywhere in this harsh cold land.\n\nUnfortunately nowadays the Rask frontier isn\u2019t the only place where the Empire has been having problems. Open war broke out with the Felkan Kingdom a couple years ago. Sometimes you wonder how things are going with Warrick and Gerald, but you\u2019ve never heard anything about them, or from them.\n\nIn fact you rarely hear news from anywhere unless it directly concerns you defending mining towns, logging town, or outposts from barbarians or the forest elves. It\u2019s never pretty here, but you can only imagine what they deal with up at Fort Defiance where they routinely face ogres and sometimes even giants. You have heard that Edgar has made quite a name for himself with some of his actions. In a way you\u2019re glad, because he\u2019s living up to the title of an Eternal and doing honor by serving with distinction\u2026still, knowing him he\u2019s doing it all to try to \u201cbeat\u201d you.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019ve made quite a name for yourself as well. You have improved the mortality rate of the soldiers here a little (most notably the ones serving under you), but you\u2019ve also managed to successfully defend several towns with low citizen casualties too.\n\nThe greatest accomplishments of yours are the complete destruction of several hostile barbarian tribes. The Black Wolves, the Enclave of the Bear, the Blood Boars, and other minor shape changing tribes have all been exterminated thanks to your relentless nature. Indeed, you\u2019ve become so infamous that the barbarian tribes in this land have come to call you the \u201cThe Bane of Rask.\u201d\n\nThis recent battle was a last desperate regroup attack by one of the tribes, the \u201cSilver Fangs\u201d after you wiped out all their women and children in an attack on their camp. Grim business to be sure, but it wasn\u2019t first time and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. These tribes must learn that they cannot stand against the might of the Empire or the Emperor. If they can only learn that with their extinction then so be it.\n\nYou report your victory to Captain Krozer.\n\n\u201cExcellent as always lieutenant. I know time after time I can count on you. Which leads me to the next major task. From what I can tell we\u2019ve managed to eliminate the major threats in this particular area of the Rask frontier, but we have two left. The forest elves and the Wendigo tribe are the two in question and I\u2019m wondering which one we should focus our attention on first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I can tell you that the Wendigo tribe will be a challenge. They\u2019re the biggest, toughest and meanest of all the barbarian shape shifters. So far we haven\u2019t had a large battle with them yet, but with our extermination of the other tribes, the time is getting closer. As for the elves, it will be more tedious than anything as they use a lot of guerilla tactics and such. We\u2019ve still never found any sort of home, base or camp of theirs, but I suppose those dark elven mercs will be more than willing to help us with eliminating them. I\u2019m sure their leader, Edolith will most likely demand a high price as usual though.\u201d You say.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Yeah, I\u2019m sure she will. Things are never easy here. Fuck it; we\u2019re pushing forward on both groups right now and putting an end to it once and for all. The question is, would you prefer to lead a company against the Wendigo tribe or go on a seek and destroy mission on the forest elves.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Attack the Wendigo tribe", "result": "\u201cWhile I have every desire to see both of these blights erased from the Empire\u2019s lands, I believe my abilities would be best served in leading the attack against the Wendigo tribe, captain.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d be more drawn to that idea, and you are probably the best person for it, seeing how many victories you have against the barbarians tribes here. Very well, I shall send another officer to lead the mission against the elves and I hope those mercenaries lower their price in exchange for a chance to kill their tree loving kin. In fact I may go along on that mission.\u201d Captain Krozer replies.\n\u201cYou are captain?\u201d\n\u201cYes, someone needs to keep an eye on those shifty bastards. Besides I find that I\u2019ve been getting stuck behind the desk too much lately. It\u2019ll be good to be back out in the field. Don\u2019t want to become like one of those fat self-important generals that do nothing except point to maps and make equally fat musings on tactics. A true leader should lead from the front, I\u2019m sure you agree.\u201d\n\u201cIt is preferable yes\u2026but I do understand the need to keep those with keen military minds safe from major war zones. Such people have their place as all do in their service of the Emperor.\u201d\n\u201cWhy lieutenant, are you complimenting me on my intelligence? It\u2019s not like you to flirt.\u201d Captain Krozer asks in a tone slightly friendlier than usual, it catches you a little off guard.\n\u201cI\u2026no! I mean yes, you are very intelligent, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRelax lieutenant, just having a little fun, didn\u2019t mean to put you on the spot. Anyway, we\u2019ll pick this up later, you better get prepared for your mission, and good luck.\u201d\n\nYou do exactly that, get prepared. You know this will not be an easy battle. You fought a member of the wendigos by yourself before and it was one of your greatest fights. Fighting an entire tribe of them even with an entire company behind you will not make it easier. Most of the men while capable soldiers, they are still just recruits in some ways when facing the shear might and savagery of these barbarians, let alone a tribe like the wendigos. At this point you wish you had a few battle wizards or even orcs in your ranks, but most of those have been assigned either at Fort Defiance or on the frontlines of the Felkan War.\n\nYou march through the ice and snow towards wendingo territory, along the way you come across a small village completely decimated. Looks like it was a fairly new one made up of some determined settlers. Still, no amount of determination could have possibly made it a good idea to start building a new settlement that was so close to wendigo territory without Empire protection.\n\nHouses have been burned, and the gory bodies of the dead are everywhere and in pieces. Some of the bodies have even been partially eaten. Not surprising, considering the wendigo tribe will cannibalize their own people if necessary. A couple of the newer recruits throw up at the grisly sight.\n\nThe march eventually leads you a wooded hill area where they make their home. It\u2019s there where you have your first major encounter with the wendigos. Their aren\u2019t a lot of them, but they\u2019re completely vicious and without fear. They think nothing of attacking you despite being outnumbered and bellow their terrible howl. A howl so dreadful it can affect the mind and causes a few of your men to lose their courage completely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in your head! The Emperor\u2019s Will protects us! Find your nerve or die!\u201d you shout and clash with the nearest wendigo.\n\nIt\u2019s just the first of many such battles. The only good thing is the wendigos are pretty easy to find and make no attempts to hide from you, meaning you don\u2019t really need to make a big effort at hunting them down. The bad thing of course is little by little your company is worn down by their attacks along with the land already being harsh and food being scarce.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that though, this land of theirs, it\u2019s making you feel weird, to say nothing of your men. The howls of the wendingos seem to be on the very winds here. It\u2019s constantly there sapping your mind and making yourself feel strange thoughts.\n\n\u201cLieutenant, I\u2019m starting to feel really hungry. A lot of the men are.\u201d Your second says to you.\n\u201cWe just stopped to eat.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I dunno I\u2019m still hungry.\u201d\n\u201cWell we\u2019re not stopping again. We need to keep moving the quicker we do this, the quicker we can go back home and have a proper meal.\u201d\n\u201cYes, a proper meal with meat. Lots of meat. Heh heh.\u201d Your second says and walks away.\n\nBy the fifth day, you finally come across a large wendigo encampment and it is there where you see some sort of leader. You knew they had to have one, these types always do. He\u2019s predictably the largest of his kind and covered in pure white fur. When your company arrives, the wendigos make their howl, but more disturbingly some of your men make a rival howl of their own and charge into battle even before you give the command.\n\nThe battle is a slaughter on both sides. You struggle against the wendigo leader striking several blows that would kill a normal man, but of course then you\u2019re not fighting a man. He swipes you across the chest destroying your breast plate and lands another blow to your head which probably would\u2019ve killed you had you not been wearing a helmet. It is enough to knock you down however.\n\n\u201cYour combat skill is impressive, Bane of Rask. It will be an honor to add it my own when I devour your heart.\u201d You suddenly hear in your head as you struggle to get up. You\u2019ve heard this sort of talk before. Namely when you were fighting against the usksha shaman.\n\nYou shake off the wendingo leader\u2019s mental attempts to throw you off guard and narrowly avoid his foot stomping on your head. You grab your sword nearby and with all your might, you swing it at the very foot that just tried to crush your head and chop it clean off.\n\nThe wendigo leader howls again, but this is one of pain as he tumbles to the ground. You waste no time and shove the blade down the beast\u2019s gullet. While this would be enough to kill most, the leader manages punch you aside with all his thrashing and then tries to stand up on one foot with a sword still stuck through his mouth and coming out the other side of his head.\n\nIt would be a darkly comical sight under different circumstances watching this beast hop around trying to pull a sword out of his head, but you\u2019re in no mood to laugh. You charge into him as hard as you can to knock him down and grab the sword yanking it back and forth until you succeed in sawing off the top part of his head.\n\nTo their credit, the remaining wendigos continue to fight and die with their leader. The battle is won and even you take a moment to rest.\n\nThis rest is to be short lived.\n\n\u201cBane of Rask, you\u2019ve just won a fierce battle wouldn\u2019t it be nice to celebrate by filling your belly with meat? There is a lot in the pot over there.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026what?\u201d you say to yourself and hold your head in your hands.\n\u201cThe pot over there. Lots of tasty meat that this tribe was going to eat before you so rudely interrupted them. No sense in letting it go to waste.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026no I just killed you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you? Of course if you wish you could just pick a body on the ground and start eating. Why not? You deserve it.\u201d\n\nYou know what\u2019s going on here. The wendigos aren\u2019t truly flesh and blood creatures! They\u2019re some sort of spirits or something otherworldly. No wonder you\u2019ve felt strange the entire time you\u2019ve been here.\n\nYou get up and call your men to leave immediately, only to see some of them have already fully succumbed to the wendigo curse.

It is at this point some of your men run as fast as then can, others begin to hold their heads telling a voice to shut up.\n\n\u201cBane of Rask, join us or die here today!\u201d you hear the voice hiss.\n\nSeveral wendigos run after the men who fled, while the others stay to attack you. For whatever reason, they\u2019re not fighting with as much reckless abandon anymore, it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019ve absorbed the fighting skills of your soldiers. Despite this, you manage to pull out a victory, but you\u2019re exhausted and wounded. You see some of your other men already beginning to transform having been possessed by the wendigos and you spare no time in killing them before they can transform as well.\n\n\u201cYour skills for killing are misused, if you just embraced the primal instinct, you would be able to use your skills to the fullest extent and without the shackles of any higher authority.\u201d\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d you shout.\n\nBetween the constant assaults to your mind and your wounds, you struggle to make your way out of wendigo territory.

You\u2019re tired, but a rage is growing within you due to these constant assaults.

Several more times you have to put down members of your own company who have turned.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until you leave those accursed wooded hills that you start to feel more like yourself, but even then the journey back isn\u2019t easy.

Truly it is only by the Emperor\u2019s strength that you managed to make it through. You only hope you have not shamed him too much with your failure.\n\nEventually you arrive at Fort Destiny and report to Captain Krozer, who is celebrating with several others in the fort. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing this unorthodox behavior, but you\u2019re certainly surprised by it.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I have my mission report.\u201d\n\u201cHey! You\u2019re back Bane of Rask! Isn\u2019t that what they call you around here? Ha ha! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back, I figured your mission would be as successful as mine! Have a drink!\u201d\n\u201cUh maybe later captain, but I\u2026did you say there was a victory?\u201d\n\u201cWell we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here getting drunk if there wasn\u2019t now would we? The campaign against the forest elves was completely successful. I have to give those svelk credit, they can sniff out their kin better than anyone. Was hardly even a fight, when we eventually did find their major home as it was filled mostly with non-combatant women and children. We\u2019d killed most of the warriors trying to get there. Still, always grim business dealing with the enemy civvies. We managed to enslave most of the children at least without killing them, though if the svelk had it their way they would\u2019ve raped and killed everyone. Uncivilized vicious bastards.\u201d The general says taking another drink.\n\u201cYou enslaved them?\u201d you ask being slightly confused by the idea.\n\u201cWell sure\u2026what you think I\u2019d just kill them? I know that\u2019s the way you do things lieutenant, and probably with those shape shifting barbarians its for the best, but let\u2019s just say I\u2019m a little more merciful than you. Hope it doesn\u2019t ruin your perception of me.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 not at all. I\u2019m sure you are right captain. The elven children can be indoctrinated to become productive citizens of the Empire. They will learn that our way of life is superior and the correct way.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s why I like you lieutenant. You don\u2019t know any better. Hey let\u2019s take this conversation back to my office, it\u2019s a little loud here.\u201d\n\nYou say okay and begin to follow her, but she grabs your hand in an effort to lead you. You aren\u2019t sure of how to react, so you just let her. When you get there she sits on her desk and smiles at you.\n\n\u201cRelax, lieutenant. I know you\u2019re an Eternal, but you\u2019re always so serious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just I really need to report my mission to you captain.\u201d\n\u201cOh very well, I know it\u2019s important to you.\u201d She says taking another drink.\n\nYou tell her exactly what happened and she listens intently to your story.\n\n\u201cWell lieutenant, looks like you managed to pull out a victory against all odds once again. I figured you would.\u201d She says.\n\u201cVictory? I don\u2019t feel like it was a victory, captain. I lost most of the company.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cNormally I might agree, but from what you told me, it\u2019s amazing you survived at all, let alone bring anyone back alive. Evil spirits, cursed lands, having to kill your own men turning into insane beasts\u2026not something I\u2019d want to face and I\u2019ve seen my fair share of battles. Besides it sounds like the spirits can\u2019t leave that area and you eliminated a majority of their hosts, as well as depriving them of more by doing what was necessary with our transformed soldiers. We\u2019ll probably always have the odd wendigo running around due to idiotic adventurers exploring places where they shouldn\u2019t, but the danger has been curtailed greatly thanks to you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s will guided me and his vigor gave me the endurance to succeed.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but you really should\u2019ve had a battle mage with you. I have no idea why central command has not sent us any despite my requests, things can\u2019t be that bad with the Felkans! Sometimes I wonder what the hell they\u2019re doing down there. Oh well at least I had you right?\u201d she says and gets off her desk.\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be here for as long I am needed here general.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She says and puts her arms around you and kisses you on the lips. You\u2019re taken completely off guard and are completely out of your element. You\u2019re reminded of Captain Pollo\u2019s advances on Gerald, but this is different since you feel a little something for Krozer even though you\u2019ve tried to not think about it. As the time you\u2019ve spent here has gone by, your thoughts of Captain Krozer have sometimes been more than a little \u201cfriendly\u201d, but you\u2019ve tried to suppress them.\n\nYou don\u2019t know how to react except you sort of back away.\n\n\u201cIs something wrong lieutenant?\u201d the general asks\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026.should we be doing this?\u201d\n\u201cOh the ranks? Forget about it. I just want sex, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m planning on falling in love. Unless you really feel uncomfortable about protocol, I\u2019d respect it of course, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, no, I mean\u2026 I\u2019ve been having these feelings of lust for you too captain.\u201d You say untactfully.\n\u201cHa ha! Well that\u2019s good to know I guess.\u201d The captain laughs. \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem then?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I just\u2026I\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNever\u2026ohhhhh! Really? Though I guess it makes sense. You were trained to kill from birth; going from battlefield to battlefield quoting Empire doctrine (sigh)\u201d the captain touches your face. \u201cSometimes I wonder if we go too far. Well don\u2019t worry about it; we\u2019ll have time to catch you up. And like I keep telling you, just relax\u2026 and call me Alison.\u201d\n\nYou and the cap\u2026Alison have an interesting time. It certainly isn\u2019t anything you\u2019ve experienced before, but its possibly the most pleasurable thing you\u2019ve ever experienced. You understand a little more to as why other soldiers hold it in such high regard.\n\nYou know not to let it affect your duty and after a few days of down time, you are ready to serve the Emperor again. Everyone is, Captain Krozer is going to do it elsewhere though, namely the Arat province on the Felkan border.\n\nShe calls you in to tell you that someone by the name of Mr. Mol has been impressed with your abilities and thinks you are able to handle the Rask frontier without any supervision. As of now you are in charge of Fort Destiny and been promoted to captain. You don\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\u201cCongratulations on your new command, though I will say I don\u2019t envy it! After being here for six years myself, I\u2019ll be glad to be sent to the Arat province. Those Felkans can\u2019t possibly be any worse than the shit we\u2019ve faced here.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an honor to serve with you captain.\u201d You say respectfully.\n\u201cOh come on, you don\u2019t need to put up a tough front with me, I know you\u2019ll miss me and cry in your pillows at night.\u201d She says with a smirk.\n\u201cI\u2026won\u2019t! I mean I\u2019ll miss you, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKeep working on developing that sense of humor, but it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019ll be missed.\u201d She says and kisses you on the cheek\n\n\u201cGood bye and remember to take a rest from all the killing sometimes and enjoy what you can okay?\u201d\n\nWith those last words, Alison walks out of her office\u2026or rather your office.\n\nAnd so begins your command of Fort Destiny.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 25\n\n\u201cAnother protest? What the hell is going on now?\u201d you say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact details, just that the miners are protesting their work conditions in the town of Keplavisk.\u201d Lieutenant Verant replies.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting sick of these protests, the Empire provides everything for these ungrateful wretches and they complain? They ought to be lucky we haven\u2019t sent slaves to do their job! Alright send a detachment there and if they don\u2019t break it up, kill a couple to make a point and remind them that it could be much worse.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\nYou sit stuck at your desk wondering when something worthwhile is going to happen. When you were first assigned to this job, the frontier was still dangerous. Even with the elimination of the wendigos and the elven home, there were still minor hostile barbarian tribes running around and sometimes even tribes of ogres or the odd giant who had wandered down from further north.\n\nEventually you eliminated all of those threats to a degree that they were no longer a factor. Then boredom set in as the area became peaceful. For a moment you tried to take Alison\u2019s advice she once gave you, but the problem is, the peace lasted too long, at least for you.\n\nLately though the boredom has become annoyance. There has been a shift in the average Empire citizen\u2019s attitude, namely one of insolence. many have started to complain about their jobs, their food, their freedom, everything. At first you questioned if it wasn\u2019t some sort of supernatural influence as that could at least be a rational explanation of this mass madness. When the first open protests started, you handled them in an efficient manner and they stopped for a while, but only for a while. It\u2019s as if the citizens want you to kill them.\n\nAnd apparently the problem isn\u2019t just here. If anything this sort of open disobedience has been rearing its ugly head in other parts of the Empire a lot more than it has here and a lot sooner.\n\nDon\u2019t these people understand that the Empire protects them and gives them everything? If it were not for Emperor\u2019s wisdom to expand, they wouldn\u2019t even have their homes, jobs in whatever province they hail from, never mind the constant vigilance to protect them against monsters that would rip them apart.\n\nSometimes you wish you had been transferred to the Arat province. At least there\u2019s a war going on there. You can only imagine that Warrick and Gerald don\u2019t have to put up with this nonsense. Assuming they are still alive, as you have heard nothing about them and despite your new ranking, you can\u2019t seem to get any information on them either. No word about about Roldan or Brenda either, but you do know that the Nalin province is known to be one of the most orderly places in the Empire now.\n\nYou would even settle for being transferred to Fort Defiance at this point, they at least have to still have to stem the tide of beasts and monsters from the north. You\u2019ve also wondered about Kane and Edgar. They\u2019re the only two you do have some updated information on, but while you\u2019ve all been in this territory for years you haven\u2019t seen them since the day you separated company. Oh you\u2019ve heard a few stories about Edgar killing giants single handedly, but that\u2019s about it. In fact you\u2019re surprised that neither one of them has earned command of Fort Defiance like you have with Fort Destiny.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s funny how thinking about something causes it to happen.\n\nYou get a message from Fort Defiance and it\u2019s from Kane! He states that he\u2019s just taken command of Fort Defiance and would like to speak with you in person about some possible joint military operations. You naturally leave for Fort Defiance immediately. A certain excitement and even happiness dwells within you, it\u2019ll be good to see a fellow Eternal again, even if Edgar is probably going to still be combative with you. Who knows though? Maybe he\u2019s changed, it\u2019s been years after all.\n\nYour trip to Fort Defiance is uneventful and when you arrive at the fort it\u2019s as large as you\u2019ve heard, but then it would have to be to fend off giants. You are greeted by several heavily armored orc troops and what looks to be a battle mage. (You still never managed to get either assigned to your fort)\n\n\u201cWelcome to Fort Defiance captain! I am to take you to General Kane. He is most eager to see you! Come this way!\u201d the battle mage says and as you are escorted through a series of dimly lit corridors one thought goes through your mind: \u201cGeneral?\u201d\n\nWhen you arrive at Kane\u2019s office he looks a little different with his head completely shaved, but other than that he hasn\u2019t changed. He also has another man in his office dressed in dark leather armor, with a cloak. You\u2019ve heard of their reputation, but this is the first time you\u2019ve seen a member of the Shadow Guard. You knew a few were stationed up here though.\n\nKane stands up and greets you.\n\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t the Bane of Rask! Ha ha ha! How are you my brother?\u201d Kane says in a jovial manner.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026brother?\u201d you reply being a little confused by Kane\u2019s demeanor and him calling you brother.\n\u201cYes! Of course! We are brothers! We grew up together, we trained together, and we fought together, and we are Eternals! Would that not constitute a brotherly bond?\u201d he says.\n\u201cHeh, I suppose it would. Never thought about it before I guess.\u201d You reply with a smile.\n\u201cHey I\u2019d like you to meet another brother of ours, this is Cyrus. Remember him? He was in our class, but he got transferred to the Shadow Guard when they first separated us.\u201d\n\u201cCyrus\u2026oh yes, I do remember him. I have sometimes wondered what happened to some of during that first separation. I guess the rest went to the Shadow Guard then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but only a few of us survived Shadow Guard training. Very few.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like us, a few of our class didn\u2019t make it through our training either.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was nothing like what you went through. Trust me.\u201d Cyrus says coldly.\n\nKane quickly intervenes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Cyrus, he\u2019s a little on the serious side, sort of like you eh?\u201d\n\u201cAs I recall I don\u2019t remember you being so talkative or jolly either.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHey what can I tell you, I\u2019ve changed as the years went by! I\u2019ve learned to take more joy in life and not worry so much about duty or about the Empire!\u201d\n\nThis last comment is cause for concern.\n\n\u201cNot worry about the Empire? What kind of talk is that for an Eternal? And I have a few questions, how did you get promoted to general? I mean why would they need a general up here, this fort has been doing fine without one, the Rask frontier is as quiet as ever and there\u2019s a war going on with the Felkan Kingdom. In fact, where is Edgar? I\u2019ve heard so much about his deeds that I would\u2019ve figured that he might get promoted to command here and certainly not to general.\u201d\n\nAt this point Kane and Cyrus look at each other and Kane looks back at you with a less cheery disposition.\n\n\u201cVery well. It was only a matter of time before I was going to have to bring this up to you anyway. I\u2019ve made myself general and as of recently this fort is no longer under Empire authority.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?!\u201d\n\u201cI saw the light, with the help of Cyrus here I suppose. The Empire is crumbling, I give it a decade at best and we need to make sure we have a good position when the shit goes down. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s why I called you here. You\u2019ve got the plebs further south of the Rask frontier under control and if we combined forces, nobody could stop us!\n\nYou\u2019re in shock for a moment. Nothing could have prepared you for something like this.\n\n\u201c\u2026Kane, you can\u2019t believe that I would go along with something like this!\u201d\n\u201cBut why not? Surely you have heard the reports of the mass civil unrest going on in the Empire, why even in your own area you have had to put civvies in their place.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and that just means we have to work harder to preserve the Empire, not abandon it in its time of need!\u201d\n\u201cBah! Why bother? It had its time in the sun and now its time for something new to take its place. What better than us? We\u2019re Eternals after all. Just think we could even unite with some of our other siblings in this dying Empire to make ourselves even stronger!\u201d\n\nYou hold your head in your hands at Kane\u2019s words of secession and treason. This is not the same man you knew, and he is certainly not your \u201cbrother.\u201d You never thought the day would come when you\u2019d have to kill a fellow Eternal.", "action_results": [{"action": "Accept his offer", "result": "It takes everything in you to not attack, but you\u2019re hoping you can bide your time to gain a better advantage.

Maybe I\u2019ve always known on some level, but it just took someone close to me to point it out. I will join your cause\u2026 my brother.\u201d\n\nKane smiles and is certainly overjoyed at your response, but Cyrus looks less than enthusiastic, in fact he\u2019s looking past you.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! I knew you\u2019d join us! I told you Cyrus!\u201d Kane says looking at Cyrus, but Cyrus is still looking past you, he makes a nod.\n\n\u201cCyrus\u2026wait no!\u201d Kane shouts\n\u201cHe\u2019s lying Kane! Kill him!\u201d\n\nYou attempt to get up and attack the battle mage behind, but unfortunately he\u2019s already anticipated that and stepped far enough way for you to not get to him in time before he\u2019s already cast a lightning bolt straight in your face. If it had been your body, perhaps you would\u2019ve survived, but a straight blast to your face fries not only your eyes so badly that they melt, but your brain as well.\n\nYou drop down dead before you can hear Kane\u2019s argument that you could\u2019ve been \u201cturned\u201d to the cause.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Decline his offer", "result": "The idea is so repugnant to you that you can\u2019t even bring yourself to even lie about joining him.

Now you do what you must, and I shall do what I must.\u201d\n\u201cTold you this was a waste of time, let us be done with this.\u201d Cyrus says and points a small crossbow on his wrist and fires it at you, though Kane knocks his hand away causing the bolt to just hit your shoulder.\n\nYou fall back in your chair and grab the battle mage who was still standing by. He falls to floor on top of you and you break his neck. You feel a little dizzy though; whatever was in that dart is putting you to sleep fast.\n\nYou hear Kane and Cyrus arguing as large orcs stomp into the office and begin kicking you as you fall unconscious.\n\nWhen you wake up, you hear an unexpected familiar voice, though the most unexpected thing is that you woke up at all.\n\n\u201cHey, get up. Good thing that weak ass poison doesn\u2019t work on us very well.\u201d Edgar says helping you up.\n\u201cEdgar? What\u2019s happened here?\u201d You ask looking around and finding yourself stripped of most of your clothing and in a cell.\n\n\u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to convince you. I told Kane that, but he kept going on about how you\u2019d understand, just like how in time I would come to understand. He said that siblings may have their fights, but in the end they always make up.\u201d\n\u201cIs that how come he hasn\u2019t killed us?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so, though I don\u2019t think Cyrus would have such sentimental feelings and would have us killed if he had more say in the matter.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Cyrus at least seems to be thinking like an Eternal in that respect. Kane has apparently gone completely mad though\u2026how the hell did this happen?!\u201d\n\u201cYou got time for a story?\u201d Edgar asks rhetorically before explaining from the beginning.\n\nEdgar says that when he and Kane first arrived they were met with a little hostility from everyone else and while their prowess in battle earned them respect, they still were never really \u201caccepted\u201d by anyone.\n\nEdgar says he didn\u2019t care of course and was content with the respect that he had earned and getting accolades for slaying giants and such. Kane wasn\u2019t handling the isolation as well and was becoming increasingly more withdrawn. He did his job, but he behaved in a manner that even the orc soldiers found a little unnerving. Nobody wanted to even eat with him, got to a point where the captain of the fort had to send him out primarily on scouting missions by himself.\n\nEdgar believes that Kane must\u2019ve really taken the split of the team harder than any of you could\u2019ve known. He suspects that might\u2019ve first lead to his quirk of referring to other Eternals as siblings. He would often mention to Edgar sometimes about how much he missed spending time with you all and couldn\u2019t wait for the day when you all would be together again.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) All he needed was for me to interact with him on a regular basis, but I was too busy concerned with my own glory. Time in this cell has really given me time to reflect on a lot of bad choices I\u2019ve made in the present and the past.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done now, but where does Cyrus come in?\u201d you ask.\n\nEdgar explains that Cyrus was transferred here four years ago as part of a replacement Shadow Guard detachment to help with the latest giant incursion. He knows Kane was sent on a mission with the Shadow Guard during that time and that\u2019s probably where they started to talk more to each other. Normally Shadow Guards don\u2019t interact with anyone other than other Shadow Guards, but Kane hung around him to such a degree that Cyrus eventually began to talk with Kane on his own accord.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Cyrus\u2019 Shadow Guard buddies approved of it too much, but he was their leader so they didn\u2019t say much.\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cSo how did they control over the whole fort?\u201d\n\nEdgar explains again that Cyrus and Kane must\u2019ve cooked up this plan in secret for years, as in time various changes began to occur.\n\nThe only initial thing that Edgar began to notice was the increase in orc troops being sent here. Granted there was always some stationed here, but now they were starting to out number the human soldiers, and he thought they were mostly going to the front lines on the Felkan border. However, this area was still very dangerous, so ultimately more orc troops here didn\u2019t raise any immediate alarms.\n\nThe next thing he noticed was that there were less and less attacks by giants and ogres, but Edgar chalked that up to him killing so many of them that naturally they would probably have less members to spare now. Not to mention with all the orcs here now, the giants were having a tougher time of it.\n\nThe third thing he noticed was Kane becoming less introverted and more aggressive towards the orcs. He witnessed several fights that Kane himself started with various orc leaders. He won with ease of course and it appeared as if he was just being combative out of boredom, but in retrospect there was very real purpose. To establish no doubt to as who is the \u201creal leader.\u201d Captain Ian wasn\u2019t fond of this sort of behavior in any way though and reprimanded Kane several times, but it was obvious he didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point I finally started to talk to Kane on a serious level, just to figure out what was going on with him. All he said to me, was you\u2019ll see in another year brother, with a great big grin on his face. Of course when that year came I found out everything. His private orc army. his alliance with the neighboring giant and ogre tribes, his plans to unite this land completely under him and take on the Empire itself. As you can see I didn\u2019t agree with his plans. I know I have my faults, but disloyalty isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s allied with ogres and giants? So wait, how long has Kane taken control of this place?\u201d You ask. \u201cWe were still getting reports from here from Captain Ian up until last month.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Captain Ian\u2019s been dead for more than a few months now! Kane\u2019s just been going through the motions of sending reports and messengers, probably to make sure you or nobody else sent anyone to investigate before he was ready to openly defy the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cBy the Emperor I can\u2019t believe I was so close and never suspected anything wrong going on up here, let alone treason!\u201d you say.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you weren\u2019t the only one. Besides like I said, I was here and I should\u2019ve been the one to do something before anyone. Instead I got myself captured. Tried to bust out a few times, I figured I\u2019d either escape or die trying. There\u2019s just too many of those tough orc bastards though. Even when I managed to get a weapon the blasted battle mage would cast some sort of spell and I\u2019d go completely weak and groggy. Then I\u2019d end up back here again. Heh, Kane\u2019s so crazy now that he still believes that I\u2019ll eventually side with him.\u201d\n\u201cDid you say battle mage? As in one?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, used to have two and they probably would\u2019ve liked to get more stationed here before unleashing their plan, but they had to make due with the ones that cooperated. I killed one of them before my first capture.\u201d\n\u201cWell they don\u2019t have any now, because I killed the other one before I got sent here.\u201d\n\nEdgar tries to contain his enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! I mean with you by my side and none of that magic shit to complicate things, you\u2019ve given us a much improved chance to escape for good!\u201d\n\nNever thought you\u2019d hear Edgar to be so happy to fight along side you, and normally you might even be a little happy too, but right now you\u2019re concerned with escape. The longer you\u2019re gone, the more likely Lieutenant Verant will send someone up here to investigate. They\u2019ll be killed of course and then Kane will undoubtedly push a full attack on to Fort Destiny ad you don\u2019t have the highest hopes that they\u2019d survive an attack by a combined army of orcs, ogres and giants without being prepared at least.\n\n\nYou waste no time coming up with a plan. Simplest ones often work the best, Edgar tells you that it\u2019ll be feeding time soon and that you should remain \u201cunconscious\u201d and he\u2019ll do the rest.\n\nYou get into position and eventually hear the footsteps of your orc jailer.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s yer food, Ed!\u201d one of them says carrying a bowl.\n\u201cHey! Why\u2019d you dump a dead body into this cell with me?\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cWha? He ain\u2019t dead he\u2019s just knocked out! I should know I was one of guys that kicked him in da head! Har har har har!\u201d\n\u201cWell he died in his sleep then from your kick to his head. I recognize him as an Eternal and Kane\u2019s gonna be pissed that you killed him!\u201d\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t dead! He sleep!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you he\u2019s dead! Don\u2019t believe me, you better check yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, I know you Ed. You gonna try bash my skull in as soon as I open door. If he really dead, then I just say you killed him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you really think Kane\u2019s gonna believe that? He knows Eternal don\u2019t kill each other, that\u2019s why he\u2019s keeping me alive even though I escape!\u201d\n\nThe orc pauses for a moment and decides he can\u2019t take the chance.\n\n\u201cBah, alright, I\u2019ll check, but I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you he\u2019s just still unconscious! That shadow guy hit \u2018im with one of doze bolts of his. But YOU are gonna do something first.\u201d\n\nThe orc tells Edgar to turn his back and get close to the cell bars, at which point the orc shackles him so her is unable to attack him. Thank the Emperor that most orcs are still not the brightest lanterns.\n\nThe orc approaches you and that\u2019s when you spring into action. You struggle with the orc jailer until you manage to grab his dagger and repeatedly stab him in the throat with it to the point where you nearly decapitate him.\n\nAfter kicking the dead orc in the face you grab his keys and release Edgar.\n\n\u201cOkay I know of a route we can try to escape through, nearly made it the last time, but again the mage showed up. That won\u2019t be a problem this time and they probably won\u2019t think I\u2019ll try it again.\u201d Edgar says.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is to concentrate on escaping the fort, though another part of you wants to go back to find Kane and Cyrus to kill them.", "action_results": [{"action": "Escape", "result": "As much as you\u2019d like to kill both Kane and Cyrus, you\u2019re outnumbered and you can\u2019t even be sure if you\u2019d catch them together again in this big fort. Better to escape and come back later better prepared to punish them. Still you\u2019re going to need some sort of gear to survive the cold outside of the fort.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just escape half naked like this. We\u2019re going to need some sort of clothing or better yet armor and weapons.\u201d You say\n\u201cYeah, there is a small supply room on the way. It isn\u2019t the main one, but it shouldn\u2019t have any guards by it either. We have to make our way to the kitchen area first, should be relatively empty right now.\u201d\n\nIt takes some sneaking around, but Edgar\u2019s knowledge of the layout gets you there with relative ease. When you do get to the room you find some old battered armor and dull weapons. It will have to do. Edgar mentions that there is a garbage dump chute in the kitchen which leads underground, from there, there\u2019s a long tunnel which eventually leads to a dead end with a hidden hatch. He says he\u2019s knows it leads into a forest area, but not much more than that since the battle mage zapped him and he was dragged back by that time.\n\nYou and Edgar sneak into the kitchen, but it isn\u2019t completely empty. The cook and a couple of his assistants are there, you and Edgar make quick work of them before they notice you, though Edgar is a little sloppier than you and the assistant that he cuts down knocks over a bunch of pots as he body hits the floor. The clatter is quite loud and you waste no time in looking for the garbage chute. It\u2019s foul and disgusting, but there\u2019s no other option. You jump in and slide down quite easy due to the slimy remains of food greasing the chute.\n\nWhen you reach the bottom a giant pile of garbage cushions you. The smell is almost overpowering, but you have no time to worry about awful smells as you are attacked by larger than normal vermin feasting through the pile. Your boots squish through the disgusting muck as you swing your weapon to drive away or kill the aggressive rats. Edgar comes crashing down from the chute and helps you.\n\n\u201cUgh, forgot how bad this place smelled.\u201d Edgar says kicking a rat.\n\u201cGuess you forgot about the giant rats as well?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I figured it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a surprise for you.\u201d\n\nYou and Edgar manage to fight your way down the small mountain of trash and make your way down the tunnel until you eventually get to a built in ladder leading up to a hatch.\n\n\u201cIs this it? It seems like a terrible idea to have this at the fort. Anyone could sneak down here and infiltrate.\u201d You mention.\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s pretty well hidden from the outside, in fact it can only open from the inside. Not like any ogre is bright enough to notice it and a giant certainly couldn\u2019t get down here. Plus it locks shut when you get outside. I think it was originally supposed to be an escape tunnel in the first place, but it looks like it got turned into a garbage pit instead. Come on.\u201d\n\nEdgar opens up the hatch and holds it open for you as you make your way to the cold outside world. You look around and it is just as Edgar said, a forest area with no major distinguishing markers. You see that the sun is setting and use that as a guide for which general direction you need to go. You figure it\u2019ll probably take a few days to get back to Fort Destiny, but you should be able to make it.\n\nYou and Edgar walk a good half hour before you realize something is wrong.\n\n\u201cShhh. You hear that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cCan\u2019t be ogres, they would\u2019ve attacked us by now.\u201d\n\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t\u2026find cover!\u201d you exclaim.\n\nSeveral bolts whiz past you as you duck down rolling around in the snow and run in a zig zag fashion getting behind several trees so as to not get hit. Edgar isn\u2019t as quick as you and he is hit by two of the bolts. Not enough to kill him, but if they have that same toxin that you experienced on them he\u2019s not going to stay conscious for long.\n\nThe Shadow Guard assailants finally show themselves and jump out of the trees. Edgar is feeling the effects of the toxin, but he struggles to stay awake to defend himself. You find yourself fighting three of the shadows that circle around you. One of them attacks and you grab his arm breaking it in one quick move, when another attacks you, you shove his broken arm friend into his blade. They both fall to the ground.\n\nThe third one lands a couple of hits on your back; cutting through the poor armor you\u2019re wearing. You deliver a hefty back kick to his gut and follow up with a spinning swipe with your sword. Your sword\u2019s edge is dull and not sharp enough to cleanly decapitate the shadow, instead it makes a large cruel gash in his neck which spurts blood like a small fountain. The result is still effective and he collapses into the snow. Your other adversary has gotten up off the ground and throws a dagger at you, which you just narrowly avoid. He tries to fight you fairly, but it\u2019s clear he is no match for you and you easily dispatch him. You then finish off the shadow with the broken arm and wound in his belly.\n\nEdgar is still fighting the two shadows attacking him. Under normal circumstances, he\u2019d probably easily dispatch them, but the toxin is having its effect and from the front and back their short swords stab him. He falls to the ground when the shadow behind him cuts at his tendons. You strike your blade into the skull of one of the shadows when he only crumples to his knees, you slam the dull blade on his head again splitting it open and revealing the gooey brains within. The last shadow tries to run away, and climb to a nearby tree in the hopes of escaping you, but you manage to jump up and grab hi dangling legs and pull him crashing to the ground. After a small scuffle you wrap your forearms around his neck and break it.\n\nYou walk over to Edgar who is still struggling to stay awake, but he\u2019s fighting more than just the toxin now, his wounds are quite severe. You kneel down beside him, it seems odd for you given your past history, but you feel a sense of sadness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2026hey\u2026did you get him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Edgar, I got him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good. I\u2019m sorr..\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the past Edgar. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d You tell him, as you know what he\u2019s going to apologize for. He then quietly loses consciousness and stops breathing altogether.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, you carry on to Fort Destiny without Edgar. You think about all the things you plan to do to Kane and Cyrus if you manage to get your hands on them the entire time you\u2019re traveling back to Fort Destiny.\n\nEventually you get to a town where you ride the rest of the way to Fort Destiny. Lieutenant Verant is relieved to see you. He says was just about to send someone up to Fort Defiance to see what happened to you. You\u2019d really like to raise your entire force from the fort and march upon Fort Defiance immediately, but you question if you\u2019d be able to take it. Other than the defenses being on full alert now, Kane may have already rallied his ogre and giant allies. It might be best if you report this back to the generals at home. Surely they\u2019ll spare you some reinforcements for something like this, not to mention they\u2019ll need to be warned anyway due to the Shadow Guard revolt that\u2019s already been in planning for quite some time. Still, it could be awhile for you to wait, not to mention they may not send you any at all. All which would be wasted time you could\u2019ve spent attacking Kane so he doesn\u2019t get too dug in.", "action_results": [{"action": "Wait for reinforcements", "result": "With all the extra allies Kane has, you can\u2019t possibly take the fort without heavy losses and with all the problems you\u2019ve been having with peasants you\u2019re still going to need enough troops to keep them in line afterwards. You need at least another army up here. You tell Verant to send a message to the generals back home about the situation and if they can provide reinforcements then to do so right away. In the meantime you\u2019re going to build up the defenses on the fort and the towns in the surrounding area.\n\nA week or so passes before you get any sort of reply. You are given orders to hold the area, but that\u2019s about it. With this new revelation of the Shadow Guard treachery and dissention within the orc ranks the generals are busily attempting to weed out any more within the home territories as well as having to redistribute regular soldiers where Shadow Guard were keeping the peasants in line. The war with the Felkans is also still going on, so any immediate reinforcements would go to that area first anyway.\n\nIn short, you\u2019re on your own as usual and reports are already coming in about ogre attacks on the outer villages. It\u2019ll only be a matter of time before those are giants or Kane\u2019s entire army of orcs. You curse your situation and prepare yourself for a long ongoing war.\n\nYear 26\n\n\u201cShoot the bastards!\u201d you shout at the catapult crews. They unleash another volley of rocks on the attacking giants. Several of the rocks hit their targets, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re not taking a barrage of large boulders either, in fact the orcs have taken to lobbing large balls of dung over the walls and it\u2019s already been starting to cause sickness among your troops. Especially after days of ongoing attack, a dwindling food supply and no relief in sight.\n\nThe months of battling Kane\u2019s traitor brigade has all lead up to this, completely surrounded by them. You did your best to hold them back, but ultimately Kane could replace his losses faster thanks to the brutality of his own troops. After ogres destroyed several of the smaller villages completely along with the mere threat of giants it wasn\u2019t long that some of the peasant communities were willing to accept Kane\u2019s \u201crule\u201d more readily than the Empire\u2019s, which they were already disgruntled with due to the lack of proper protection among other things.\n\nThe Shadow Guard didn\u2019t help matters as most of them that had been rooted out in the home territories fled up to the Rask under Cyrus\u2019 leadership, along with some of the orcs that had heard about the rebellion. Any towns that hadn\u2019t immediately fell under the sway of the direct fear from Kane\u2019s army fell to the subversive and terror tactics of the Shadow Guard.\n\n\u201cGet those orcs on the north side! They\u2019re climbing up the fucking walls!\u201d you shout.\n\nBoiling oil is thrown over the side of the wall, scalding the orcs on ladders. Some of them fall, others are tougher and maintain their grip. You shove the ladder back, making sure to get the ones that the oil failed to. You look around and see that the orcs have begun to break through the front door. You then have that familiar sense that you\u2019ve had so many other times over the past few months. You duck down and roll while swinging your sword in front of you. You hit something and uncloak a Shadow Guard that has managed to infiltrate the fort. He isn\u2019t the only one though. Several more appear nearby to kill the remaining men you have defending the walls.\n\nYou continue to fight valiantly, cutting down many of the Shadow Guard that have managed to get inside the fort. A boulder crashes into the side of the wall destroying it and causing you to fall off the walkway and to the ground within the fort.\n\nYou get back up as quickly as you can to see orcs pouring into the front gates and the remainder of your men slaughtered. Griping your sword one last time your only regret is not taking the opportunity to kill Kane and Cyrus a year ago when you were captured at Fort Defiance. Indeed you played everything a bit too cautiously. None of it matters now though, the only thing you can do is go out like a true warrior. If not victory, then you can take comfort in that at least.\n\n\u201cFor the Empire!\u201d you shout and charge into the horde.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "March upon the fort now", "result": "You can\u2019t wait. You may serve the Empire and be against Kane\u2019s traitorous ways, but there is an unfortunate element in truth in what he says. If you need to get anything done around here, you\u2019ll have to do it yourself, not rely on the Empire. You tell Verant to send a message to the generals back home about the situation and if they can provide reinforcements then to do so right away, but in any case you\u2019re attacking Fort Defiance immediately.\n\nYou muster up all your forces, troops, siege weapons, everything that could help you and leaving only a skeleton crew back to guard Fort Destiny. When you begin your march, you try to remain confident that you can take the fort. As soon as you start to enter the long stretches of snowy wilderness that precede Fort Defiance, tribes of ogres attack you. Kane\u2019s already prepared.\n\nWithin a mile of Fort Defiance and you can see large looming figures in the distance almost as big as the fort itself. You have to remind your troops to find their courage and that no overgrown abomination is going to best any soldier of the Empire.\n\nOn the first day of the siege your catapults hurl their boulders at the fort and your ballistae fire at the giants. It\u2019s an impressive volley, which damages the walls and critically wounds some of their giant allies, but the counter attack is just as brutal to your side. Multiple boulders comes crashing down on your men hurled by the giants. Fort Defiance\u2019s own ballistae aim for your siege weapons, destroying several of them.\n\nBy the third day, you pull your sword out of the last giant after stabbing him several times in the neck and jump several feet to the ground just before his falling body and crush you. Your men are still attempting to break down the doors of the fort which is heavily reinforced. Attempting to scale its walls results in them being scalded to death by boiling oil. The orcs have even resorted to catapulting their dung at you; it\u2019s only going to be a matter of time before disease starts to take effect on your men. You would\u2019ve tried the same thing, but orcs are notoriously resistant to such biological warfare.\n\nBy the fourth day, your troops are dwindling and you\u2019re still no closer to capturing the fort. Ogre tribes harass your people from the outside and you lead your best men to the hidden hatch you escaped from. Upon finding it again, you destroy the hatch door and descend. When you and your men arrive at the garbage pile though, you\u2019re in for a minor surprise, as a troop of orcs are waiting for you. Apparently somebody figured you might try to get in this way.\n\nThe battle with the orcs isn\u2019t a pleasant one. Along with the smell, there is also the disgusting ichor that\u2019s ankle deep as you fight the orcs. Through the filth and trash though you manage to maintain your composure and dispatch the orcs with the help of your men. After the fighting is over, your next plan is to climb up the chute and do damage from within. It takes a little exertion due to the chute being incredibly greasy, but eventually you manage to apply pressure to the sides of the chute and start climbing up it slowly. Your men do likewise.\n\nYou\u2019re about midway through this slimy tube when all of a sudden the top part opens up and your heart sinks when an orcish face appears.\n\n\u201cHah, boss waz right. Time to burn now!\u201d he says and throws at torch at you. Normally this wouldn\u2019t do much damage by itself, but with the combination of grease, oil and other flammable muck you\u2019ve been rolling around it, you light up like a tinderbox along with the entire grease covered chute. You lose your grip and slide back down crashing into your men and setting them on fire as well.\n\nWhen you hit the pile of garbage below, you\u2019re completely engulfed by the flames and the garbage pile goes up like an inferno.

That\u2019s less likely to happen without Kane or Cyrus here.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think someone else will take their place?\u201d\n\u201cI KNOW someone else will take their place, but by getting rid of Kane and Cyrus that shaky allied army that they\u2019ve built up will fall apart.

He probably doesn\u2019t seem like it to you, but he has a certain charm about him. It\u2019s how he\u2019s managed to convince Kane to go along with all this I imagine.\u201d\n\u201cSo this was all Cyrus\u2019 idea.\u201d You say still scanning the room.\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that I think, even I\u2019m not privy to all the details. I only know as much as I do because Cyrus is a little more talkative after sex\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t need to hear about that!\u201d Edgar exclaims.\n\n\u201cLook we could stand around and talk all day until the guards realize something is wrong, or you can accept the help of me and the rest of the Shadow Guard. We have come to realize for a while now that this plan is not in our best interest and will only lead to our destruction.\u201d The voice says,\n\u201cYou do realize that you have already participated in treason and this attempt at switching sides because you know you\u2019ll lose anyway, will not save you?\u201d you say undiplomatically.\n\u201cHa ha! Yes, I would expect no less from the Empire and especially not from an Eternal such as yourself. You Eternals, you think in such absolutes and that\u2019s why you\u2019ll be the death of us all\u2026not YOU of course, but for the rest of us.

Anyway it hardly matters now, I\u2019m still offering my help\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore the man can complete his sentence you have managed to locate his whereabouts in the room and grab him. His invisibility disappears to reveal a mundane looking man in a gray cloak. As you hold your sword to him, Edgar does likewise.\n\n\u201cI hate to burst your ego, but this isn\u2019t the first time an Eternal has managed to detect me, you took longer though.\u201d The gray-cloaked man says.\n\u201cHow can I trust someone who has defied the Emperor and participated in treasonous acts?\u201d you ask, ignoring the Shadow Guard\u2019s flippant nature.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. And being a Shadow Guard probably makes me even less trustworthy. The only thing I can say is you\u2019ll have to make a leap of faith Eternal. I will confess this though. The Shadow Guard\u2019s loyalty to the Empire is starting to be less than absolute. Granted there are still debates about this within our order and not everyone can decide on how we should do it. Personally I felt we should all just leave and not make a big mess about it. Obviously some, like Cyrus feel otherwise. Now I have just relayed perfectly good intelligence on a potential major threat to the Empire. You will be able to warn others after you take care of Kane and Cyrus.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Trust the Shadow Guard", "result": "You still don\u2019t trust the Shadow Guard, but if what he\u2019s claiming is even partly true then it is indeed something you need to warn others about. This idea of mass treason by the Shadow Guard is troubling to you as their reputations for loyalty to the Empire are impeccable\u2026but then Eternals were supposed to be without disloyalty either.\n\nThere will definitely be a reckoning after this immediate problem is taken care of.\n\n\u201cVery well, we\u2019ll accept your help, if only because there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop us anyway.\u201d You say releasing the man.\n\u201cSpoken like an Eternal. Okay while you track down and face Kane, my brother and sister shadows will create chaos with the orc troops. That should give you plenty of time to kill him and escape.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Cyrus?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably be with Kane discussing strategies as usual, at least I hope he will be. I don\u2019t relish the thought of having to face him myself even with the rest of the shadows behind me. That would be a rather bloody break up and probably not in my favor. But I\u2019m sure you two will have no problems. Let\u2019s get to it shall we?\u201d\n\nAt this point you and Edgar reluctantly leave the Shadow Guard to carry out his part of the plan.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really trust him do you?\u201d Edgar asks.\n\u201cOf course not, but if there is the chance that he\u2019ll help it\u2019s a gamble I\u2019m willing to take. We\u2019re already severely outnumbered and in hostile territory if he was lying then nothing was really lost. Let\u2019s get to Kane\u2019s office, that\u2019s probably where he\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nYou manage to walk through the halls of the fort without difficulty thanks to the face covering helmets. Everyone just assumes you\u2019re just two soldiers going about your routines. When you arrive near the office there are several heavily armored orc guards milling around there. You and Edgar briefly wonder how quickly you can kill them before more come running, but fortune strikes, when another one comes running for a completely different reason.\n\n\u201cAy! Ay! You guyz! The prisoners have escaped and doze shadoze are in on it! They snuck up and attacked us in our own quarters! Come on!\u201d the orc yells.\n\u201cWha?! Never did trust dat lot! We can\u2019t leave, da boss is in his office!\u201d one of the guard says.\n\u201cWe gotta tell \u2018im anyway!\u201d another guard adds about to enter the office.\n\u201cHey we\u2019ll tell the general and you take care of the shadows. You orcs are tougher so you\u2019ll be able to handle the situation better than we would. Besides you should go get yourselves some payback for what those bastards have done.\u201d You pipe up and say.\n\u201cYeah! Da humie iz right! Okay, you tell da boss and we\u2019ll take care of doze shadoze!\u201d one of them says and they all going running off without realizing a thing.\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve been serving along side these orcs for years and it still baffles me how Captain Gruz was so articulate and intelligent when compared to the rest of his kind.\u201d Edgar remarks.\n\u201cWonder about it later, we\u2019ve got more important matters.\u201d You say opening the door, and stepping into Kane\u2019s office.\n\nKane steps out of his private quarters wondering what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on out there, I heard all this\u2026you\u2019re not my bodyguards!\u201d\n\u201cAn Eternal shouldn\u2019t need them, but then you\u2019re no Eternal, you\u2019re a traitor!\u201d you shout.\n\nKane draws his weapon and the fight commences. Kane always was one of the more skilled fighters when he served under you, but it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s improved even more when he manages to disarm Edgar within moments and knocks him into the wall.\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this brothers!? I\u2019m trying to help us! We could join forces! We could all be a family again! It\u2019s not too late!\u201d Kane pleads while defending himself.\n\u201cIt is too late for you! You\u2019ve been a fool to believe Cyrus\u2019 lies, where is he?\u201d you yell narrowly missing Kane.\n\nKane ignores your questions and fights back with less reluctance. Edgar attempts to help you again, but Kane once more proves to be the better fighter, smashing him in the face and stabbing him in the leg. Edgar falls to the floor.\n\n\u201cCyrus was right, I wasted my time with you! And you never were the great warrior you thought you were!\u201d Kane says almost landing a killing blow on Edgar, but you manage to save him by deflecting the sword blow.\n\nKane attempts to counter attack but fails and you land a blow across his chest and then another across his face, blinding him in one eye. He drops his weapon and staggers back holding his hand on the gaping bloody wound.\n\n\u201c(Pant) Why\u2026you\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d he wheezes and tries to escape past you, but you stop him completely by running him through. You wrench the sword upward to slice further into his internal organs. Blood spills out from the wound and onto the floor and your feet. He looks at you with his remaining good eye. Surprisingly, he smiles.\n\n\u201cI\u2026forgive you\u2026broth\u2026\u201d he gasps and dies.\n\nIt\u2019s strange; you feel satisfaction for killing a traitor to the Emperor, yet a small part of you feels something else. Sadness perhaps? You turn and see Edgar recovering from his wounds.\n\n\u201cThanks. Saving me again, must feel like old times.\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cOld times didn\u2019t involve me killing one of us, speaking of which we need to go find Cyrus.\u201d\n\nYou and Edgar leave Kane\u2019s office and hear the sounds of chaos filling the halls. A human soldier turns the corner and you nearly decapitate him before he shouts at you to stop. He doesn\u2019t recognize you since you still have the helmets on.\n\n\u201cHey hold on! I\u2019m human! Man, looks like you guys must\u2019ve fought some of those orc fuckers as well. Have you seen General Kane? He\u2019s supposed to be keeping these idiots under control and they\u2019ve completely lost it!\u201d\n\u201cGeneral Kane\u2019s dead. The orcs killed him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fuckin\u2019 dead? Great, he and Cyrus got us into this mess and he\u2019s dead and the other one is missing!\u201d\n\u201cWhere is Cyrus?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but what I do know is all those Shadow Guard assholes caused all this strife by attacking the orcs in the first place! Then they just took off! At this point I don\u2019t know why I ever listened to this idiotic scheme of breaking away from the Empire! If we get out of this alive, we\u2019ll be lucky if the Empire doesn\u2019t hang us all for treason!\u201d\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019ll take care of that right now.\u201d You say and strike down traitor before he can act.\n\nYou curse the fact that Cyrus and the rest of his shadows got away, but there\u2019s no way to track them now, so you and Edgar decide to make your escape from the fort.\n\nYour escape is fairly easy. When you and Edgar arrive back at Fort Destiny where Lieutenant Verant says he was just about to send someone up to Fort Defiance to see what happened to you. Your own command is to raise every soldier from Fort Destiny and march upon Fort Defiance.\n\nBy the time you arrive, the fort is half in ruins and burning. All the human soldiers have been killed and the surviving orcs have reverted back to their uncivilized nature. It\u2019s a bloody battle, but after it\u2019s all said and done, every orc is slaughtered for their lack of loyalty.\n\nYou report the events to your superiors and tell them everything that happened and Edgar backs up the story with his confirmations as well as his own experiences at Fort Defiance. The news is devastating and drastic measures are taken in an attempt to maintain order.\n\nThe first thing is Fort Defiance is completely abandoned with no plans to rebuild it. The area falls back under the dominion of giants and ogres once again. The small villages that do exist up there are soon destroyed, as they have no protection at all anymore. Fort Destiny takes up the duty of driving away the monstrous tribes that do wander further south now. The lives of the Empire citizens in the Rask frontier are now as hard as they were when you first arrived at the place.\n\nNext a full investigation is made on every Shadow Guard member, at least the ones the Empire manages to get a hold of. Many openly resist, while other still just make their escape when they can. After a series of major decisions, the Shadow Guard is purged, even some of the ones who claimed their undying loyalty. Their number, while small to begin with, is reduced to zero and bounties are placed on the few that escaped. Including Cyrus.\n\nAs for the orcs, their kind is spared from any sort of major investigation, though it might be because most of them are serving on the front lines of Felkan War and enough of them are getting killed there to thin out their ranks. Not to mention they\u2019re generally not seen as intelligent to be as much of a major threat and it was only due to the manipulation of Cyrus and Kane that they turned. Still, they are watched and they are never to be stationed in such a way that they outnumber human troops again. Questions still abound to as who allowed such orders to transfer so many to Fort Defiance in the first place.\n\nOddly even though Cyrus and to a lesser extent Kane were the leaders of this attempted secession, no Eternal is investigated. If anything you\u2019re rewarded with a medal for your service to the Empire. Edgar isn\u2019t though for some reason.\n\nYou maintain your post at the Rask frontier though Edgar is transferred to the Felkan front. You say your goodbyes to him on a friendlier note this time, which after what happened with Kane, you\u2019re glad to do.\n\nYour position at Fort Destiny is less monotonous now, but its a thankless one as always. The citizens in the area still complain and protest even though you\u2019re protecting them. And despite all their precautions and attempts to crack down on order, the events at Fort Defiance are just the beginning of what the Empire has yet to experience in the years to come.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 30\n\n\u201cThis place won\u2019t be the same without you sir. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll be able to run this place as well as you.\u201d Lieutenant Verant says as you finish packing your things.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine lieutenant, or should I say captain. You\u2019ll probably get an official promotion soon. Just remember, when the citizens protest I\u2019ve found that flogging one family with children at random keeps the rest in line. Can\u2019t really afford to execute them like we did in the old days, too many ogre attacks already doing a good job of that. Well at least you don\u2019t need to worry about the giants as much anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou always did know best sir.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I tried to do what I could up here. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m being stationed to Delerg Province. It\u2019s one of the more peaceful places of the Empire next to the Nalin province. I would prefer to be here or on the Felkan frontlines where I could do more to serve, but I suppose the Emperor knows best where my skills will be used.\u201d\n\u201cOh well I\u2019ve heard the war with the Felkans is coming to an end soon.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard that as well\u2026and it concerns me the things that I\u2019ve heard why it\u2019s ending. Mass riots in the major cities of the Empire, soldier shortages, even heard about some of those traitorous shadow criminals carrying out terrorist tactics. And because of these problems what do we do with the Felkans? Another non-aggression pact! We should be butchering them and burning down their cities, not making peace with them again. If all of the Emperor\u2019s enemies had one neck, I would sever it with one sword swipe.\u201d\n\nVerant says nothing after your rant. Indeed over the past few years he\u2019s heard you rant about the troubles of the Empire a lot more and knows to keep quiet. But if you\u2019re making more outbursts than usual, it\u2019s only because the Empire has more problems than usual.\n\nLately you\u2019ve been questioning how \u201cgreat\u201d the Empire is supposed to be. This is not the place you heard about when you were being trained by Mistress or Captain Gruz. In fact, during your first assignment in the Nalin province you encountered decadent officers and disobedient citizens even then.\n\nThis questioning of the Empire then makes you question the Emperor which causes you great concern for that it treasonous thinking. But still\u2026how is it he has allowed this to happen to his land? He is supposed to be all wise and all-powerful, but you\u2019ve not seen much evidence of either. Never mind the fact that you\u2019ve never seen him at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare thought, but there have been even a few times where you wondered what would\u2019ve happened if you had joined Kane when he asked.\n\nYou leave Fort Destiny without another word and board the carriage to the Delerg province.\n\nA few days later you arrive and Delerg is everything you\u2019ve heard about, very swampy. The town you\u2019re scheduled to arrive in looks like it\u2019s sinking into marsh, which might explain why it\u2019s even called Sinkhole.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here, you do know you\u2019re supposed to meet with a contact here, though you don\u2019t know who that is or where you\u2019re supposed to meet.\n\nAs you take in the sights of this dismal town, the villagers look like they can barely contain their fear of you. You aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because they\u2019ve heard of your reputation, or if it\u2019s due to their natural suspicious nature. The swamp folk have always been known to be that way. They were one of the few people that didn\u2019t resist Empire dominion at all when they first came to this land, but despite this submissiveness the swamp folk still maintained their wary ways.\n\n\u201cWell if isn\u2019t the Bane of Rask! It\u2019s been a long time!\u201d a voice calls out to you. You turn around and see not one, but two familiar faces.\n\u201cRoldan? Gerald?\u201d you say seeing how much older they\u2019ve gotten. It makes you realize just how much time has passed.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s us!\u201d Roldan says.\n\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be the contact.\u201d Gerald adds.\n\u201cContact? I\u2019m not anyone\u2019s contact. I\u2019m supposed to meet someone here, you guys aren\u2019t it?\u201d you say.\n\u201cErm, no. In fact when Gerald arrived I thought he was the contact and vice versa. Well this is odd. I wonder who we\u2019re supposed to be meeting?\u201d\n\nYou reply that you don\u2019t know and then begin to feel slightly uneasy. With all your past experiences, you start to feel like this might be a trap, then another carriage comes into the town. When the passenger steps out, it\u2019s an old, but still tough looking orc in battle armor. It\u2019s Captain Gruz! He sees all three of you milling about in the open and shuffles over to you.\n\n\u201cWhat in blazes are you lot doing out in the open like this? Any potential assassin could strike you down! I thought I taught you better than that! Come on let\u2019s get into the tavern, we can talk there.\u201d He scolds and then heads towards the tavern, you, Gerald and Roldan follow.\n\nThe tavern is dark and nearly empty. The patrons inside see you four sit at a table and then move as far away as possible.\n\n\u201cYou thirsty? I sure am. Four ales!\u201d Captain Gruz says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not thirsty captain.\u201d You say.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not for you, they\u2019re for me! You guys order your own drinks! Anyway I imagine you\u2019re all wondering what this small reunion is all about. Well let\u2019s just say the Empire finally saw fit to take me off the sidelines and place me in charge of something worthwhile for a change. I\u2019ll get right to the point and tell you, the Shadow Guard is here, or at least what\u2019s left of them. For awhile we thought that they might be working with the Felkans, but they\u2019re just taking advantage of the war.\u201d\n\nThis news causes you to sit forward and then look around.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not right HERE, lad. They\u2019re in this province though; and you might be interested that Cyrus is the one leading this miserable little band of shadows. I imagine you and he got some unfinished business. In fact that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, since you\u2019ve had a lot of experience in dealing with this situation before. As for you two, your own records are excellent and you\u2019re Eternals. The only ones that are going to be skilled enough to handle this situation I think are Eternals.\u201d\n\u201cHow come Edgar isn\u2019t here? He also had experience with the Shadow Guard and was with me during the Fort Defiance incident.\u201d\n\u201cEh, Edgar\u2019s skills are best served on the Felkan frontlines right now. I know the war might be coming to an end, but there\u2019s still quite a bit of fighting going on. Besides best not to have all you guys in one place.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a different perception than I remember you having when you were arguing with Mr. Mol fourteen years ago.\u201d You say.\n\u201cHeh, remembered that did you? Well, as I\u2019m sure you know things change, ideas change. You get older and see things differently. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\nYou pause before answering, which causes Gruz to study you for a moment.\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d You reluctantly reply.\n\u201cOf course you do, lad. You\u2019d be a bleeding idiot if you didn\u2019t.\u201d Gruz says taking a drink of one of his ales.\n\u201cSo, where are these Shadow Guard fanatics anyway?\u201d Gerald asks.\n\u201cAn old temple deep in the swamps. Used to be their old place of worship back before their Empire days apparently. Looks like Cyrus really bought into that dead religion, though it\u2019s also arrogant of him to try to hide right underneath our noses. Hell, who knows? Maybe he knew he\u2019d get discovered eventually and was just itching for a fight. Anyway, we\u2019ll have some extra help when we arrive there. Trust me, I\u2019ve got it set up.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of the time is playing a little catch up with your former team members while Captain Gruz enjoys his ale. It\u2019s interesting to see how vastly different their experiences have been.\n\nGerald says his time was initially boring until the war broke out. From then on he and Warrick were constantly paired up to perform commando mission deep into Felkan territory. Dangerous work, but he says they were treated pretty well by everyone and held in high regard among their fellow soldiers. Even the citizens were less troublesome in the Arat province and the local women threw themselves at him and Warrick every night he laughs.\n\nRoldan mentions his time was mostly spent cleaning up the rest of the kobolds in the Nalin province, breaking small bandit rings, and ultimately trying to keep the peasants in line. No problems from the usksha again though. When Captain Anu was promoted and sent to the Felkan frontlines, Brenda got promoted to command Fort Glory. The most surprising thing though, he and Brenda apparently married. Wasn\u2019t anything fancy and there was paperwork that had to be filled out (A lot of it) but it was completely approved of by the Empire.\n\nYour own tales sound remarkably grim when compared to theirs.\n\nThe strangest thing about all this is how they\u2019ve all had contact with each other either directly or through messages. Gerald and Roldan even mention how they got letters from Kane years ago before his actions at Fort Defiance. They both confirm how the letters sounded very longing of the \u201cold days\u201d and referring to them as \u201cbrother.\u201d Warrick and Brenda apparently got similar ones too.\n\nYou ask Gerald if he met Edgar when he was transferred there. He replies that he did, but said that he was mostly sent to fight Felkan armies directly right along side most of the orcish detachments.\n\n\u201cSheesh. He\u2019s gotta love that considering his experiences with orcs at Fort Defiance.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEdgar\u2019s an idiot. Always has been. I saw that even when I was training you guys. He\u2019s a good warrior, but lacks vision. Surprised he\u2019s lasted this long.\u201d Captain Gruz suddenly replies.\n\u201cWell, I agree he\u2019s always had a tendency to act without thinking, but after my last dealings with him, I think he\u2019s improved a bit. Changed his outlook. You know, got older and sees things differently now.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cHmm. Maybe, but as far as I\u2019m concerned being a meat shield is about the best thing he\u2019s ever been good for, just like all the rest of dumb fuckers on the Felkan frontlines.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m on the Felkan frontlines!\u201d Gerald protests.\n\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re not marching straight into those Felkan shooty weapons either. You\u2019re being a lot more than just a meat shield like the rest of those stupid ass orcs.\u201d\n\u201cRest of those orcs? Not to point out the obvious, but you\u2019re an orc, I mean aren\u2019t those your people?\u201d Roldan asks.\n\u201cYeah and? Does that make us all relatives or some shit? Fuck my people! I got no patience for any of them anymore\u2026\u201d Captain Gruz begins to get loud and cause a scene.\n\n\u201cOkay captain I think you\u2019ve had enough. I think I saw an inn across the way, let\u2019s get some rooms there and make plans to deal with the shadows tomorrow.\u201d You suggest.\n\u201cGrrm, maybe you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Captain Gruz replies and then promptly falls to the floor. Gerald tries to pick him up.\n\n\u201cSomebody go get the rooms and the other person help me carry the captain.\u201d Gerald says.", "action_results": [{"action": "Help carry the captain", "result": "\u201cGo get the rooms Roldan, I\u2019ll help Gerald.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Roldan agrees and leaves.\n\nYou and Gerald help the Captain Gruz up who is mumbling things the whole time.\n\n\u201cFucking idiots. It was perfect\u2026who I am kidding? It was futile to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cJust settle down sir.\u201d Gerald says trying to calm him down.\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll kill me too? Hey I\u2019m not tryin\u2019 ta put the moves on ya, you got your arm around me!\u201d\n\nGerald gets quiet really fast and even you start looking around.\n\n\u201cOh what? You think I didn\u2019t hear about that incident? Ha ha ha! Relax, ya did the right thing, fuckin\u2019 degenerate deserved it\u2026\u201d Gruz laughs.\n\nYou\u2019re just about to get to the door and that\u2019s when you hear yelling and an explosion coming from the outside followed by screams. The force of it is enough to cause you all to fall back a bit.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d you blurt out and leave Gerald to tend to the captain.\n\nYou look around and see a couple of damaged buildings, more than a few dead bodies in pieces. Your heart sinks though when you see Roldan lying on the ground in front of the damaged inn.\n\nWhen you rush over to him, his insides are clearly visible and one of his legs is gone. He struggles to breathe as he looks up at you. You can\u2019t do anything for him.\n\n\u201cFuck. Damnit\u2026\u201d you quietly say and kneel down towards his bloody body.\n\u201c\u2026tell Brenda that I love her.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026that\u2019s good\u2026hey if we\u2019re all\u2026all siblings like Kane said\u2026that\u2026that doesn\u2019t make Brenda\u2026my sister\u2026does it?\u201d Roldan asks with a small smile.\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t think so, and even if it did so what? You found happiness with her.\u201d You smile back.\n\u201cYeah\u2026you\u2019re right. You\u2026 usually were.\u201d he says and then drifts away.\n\nThis time you do feel sadness at the loss of one of your own. Especially when you had just gotten to know him again. Gerald dashes over to you and even captain Gruz has sobered up a bit from this incident and is now interrogating the nearest hysterical citizen.\n\n\u201cWho the fuck did this?! Answer me woman!\u201d he demands and slaps her a few times, but she just pathetically cries and begs him to stop.\n\u201cCaptain! Stop it! It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t know anything!\u201d Gerald shouts.\n\u201cMaybe not, but someone here does.\u201d You say. \u201cAlright, listen up! I am an Eternal and the man laying dead next to me was also an Eternal! My wrath for his death shall be the likes you\u2019ve never known and you don\u2019t want to know. One of you saw something, so someone better start talking or else this little town you call home is going to get a whole lot bloodier.\u201d\n\nNobody says anything for a while and there\u2019s just dead silence, but eventually a little girl comes out from behind a barrel and speaks up.\n\n\u201cI saw something Mr. Eternal.\u201d\n\u201cGood, glad to see this town isn\u2019t completely infested with cowards. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d You say and take the girl to a room at the inn and proceed to question her.\n\nThe girl is still a little nervous at first, but soon opens up quite a bit. She mentions that she was walking home from the general store and she saw Roldan leaving the tavern. He was almost to the inn when she saw these two figures shimming like they were almost invisible. She then says what happened next was very quick. The figures ran up to Roldan and then these two men appeared in gray cloaks. They both stabbed him several times before he could defend himself.\n\nDespite his wounds, he managed to stab one through the neck and grabbed the other when he tried to escape. She said at this point she had been hiding behind the barrel, but saw that the man in gray produced a gas sphere plant from his cloak and he yelled something she couldn\u2019t understand. A blackish field started to emanate from the man, Roldan then fell to the ground and then the large explosion occurred killing several people that didn\u2019t have the sense that the little girl did to get the hell out of there as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cSo much for the shadows not being here.\u201d Gerald remarks.\n\u201cShit, I fucked up. I should\u2019ve known that they might\u2019ve realized that we we\u2019re coming.\u201d Captain Gruz says.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter anyway. It\u2019s obvious they\u2019re prepared for a last stand sort of fight, if they\u2019re willing to blow themselves up. No sense in depriving them of that, though I\u2019m hoping they don\u2019t start favoring blowing themselves up. It\u2019s going to make fighting them more dangerous than it should be.\u201d You say.\n\u201cMmm, I know what you mean. Serving on the Felkan frontlines I had to experience several of their own explosive type weapons first hand, but from what I\u2019ve heard those gas plant spheres aren\u2019t common and grow rarely even in this area. Even then, they aren\u2019t explosive on their own. The shadow probably used some sort of magic to make it explode like that. Is that right little girl?\u201d Gerald asks to confirm, to which she nods.\n\n\u201cAlright enough talk, we all need to get some rest before wiping the bastards out tomorrow.\u201d Captain Gruz says and lies down on his bed.\n\nAt this point you send the little girl away and tell her she\u2019s served the Empire well and leave with Gerald.\n\n\u201cDo you really think Gruz should be coming with us tomorrow? I mean with his leg and his age and all.\u201d Gerald asks.\n\u201cIf he wants to go on one last mission then I\u2019m not going to deprive him of that. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll keep up. I get the impression this is sort of personal to him.\u201d\n\u201cPersonal to him? I imagine it\u2019s personal to you a lot more.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I\u2019m trying to not let it.\u201d\n\nOf course that\u2019s pretty hard to do when you have to put Roldan in a casket and sent back to Brenda. Gerald writes the letter to her. You can only imagine what her reaction is going to be about this news. This makes you wonder about the whole scenario that they were in love and got married. You know you briefly spoke to Roldan about this back at the tavern, but a lot of it still baffles you. How did it first come about? What was it like? Who initiated it? Was the attraction always there, even back when you were all in training? Could something like that ever happen to you?\n\nYou think about the time you were with Captain Krozer and that\u2019s the closest equivalent you have, but you know that wasn\u2019t anything like love. You did respect her though and you\u2019re pretty sure the feeling was mutual. Perhaps that\u2019s how it started, but Brenda and Roldan were just in contact with each long enough to develop it further.\n\nEventually you dismiss all these meaningless thoughts and rest up to prepare for your mission tomorrow.\n\nThe next morning, you Gerald and Gruz set off on your journey. The trip through the swamps isn\u2019t an easy one; it actually makes you long for the days of stomping through ice and snow. The whole time you\u2019re traveling you\u2019re constantly alert and feel like at anytime you could be attacked, which turns out to be true with the oversized insects and other minor hostile swamp animals dwelling here, but they aren\u2019t the enemies you\u2019re expecting.\n\n\u201cSo how many Empire troops are we going to have as back up?\u201d Gerald asks Gruz during the trip.\n\u201cEmpire? I\u2019m lucky I managed to get them to accept my request to go on this mission! They didn\u2019t send me anyone, not that they\u2019d be much help anyway. Most Empire soldiers would stick out like a sore thumb and get themselves killed before they even reached the place. No, I\u2019m relying on the ones that found these ruins to begin with. Dark elven mercs. If anyone can hide out better than the shadows, it\u2019ll be them.\u201d Gruz replies.\n\nDark elves. You hated having to work with them back in your early years on the Rask frontier, but you can\u2019t deny their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cShh! Do you hear that?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cProbably another Sul Monkey. Those things are all over the place. Just glad it\u2019s not mating season for them, otherwise we might be in big trouble. Hey, aren\u2019t you humans related to them in some way?\u201d Gruz asks.\n\nGerald is about to reply, and then you hear a whizzing sound followed by a \u201cthunk\u201d sound. You then see Gerald with a large crossbow bolt directly in the center of his head. A single trickle of blood comes from the wound and drips off his nose.\n\n\u201cI\u2026been hit\u2026\u201d Gerald says and his eyes roll back as he falls into the soft mushy ground.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Gruz shouts and ducks down into the mud.", "action_results": [{"action": "Duck down into the mud as well", "result": "You instinctively duck down into the mud like Gruz did; regrettably the hidden assassin anticipated that and begins shooting downward.\n\nYou and Gruz both receive several bolts to the back. Gruz manages too shake off these annoyances partly because he\u2019s wearing heavy armor and the other because as an orc his skin is pretty tough to begin with, especially with his experience.\n\nWhile you\u2019re certainly wearing protective gear as well and an Eternal to boot, the bolts sink into your flesh a lot easier and deeper. The pain is great, but you manage to get back up in an effort to find better cover. Gruz spots the shadow assassin and engages him unfortunately two more shadows jump down from the trees to finish you off. Under normal circumstances you\u2019d easily be able to handle the pair of them even with bolts in your back, but in typical shadow fashion, the bolts were dipped in some sort of poison, not strong enough to kill you, but enough to make you sleepy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this drowsiness that is your downfall. You swing at the two shadows a few times before they manage to land their own attacks on you. A quick slash to your neck releases an arterial spray and you\u2019re dead before you even hit the ground.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Hide behind a tree", "result": "From the trajectory of the bolt, the assassin is in front and probably was trying to hit you instead of Gerald. You immediately run for the nearest tree as several more bolts whiz past you.\n\nWhen you reach the tree two Shadow Guards jump down from it and attempt to stab you. You kick one in the groin as hard as you can, while deflecting the blow of the other with your sword. You dodge another attack by falling to the ground and chopping the shadow at one of his legs, nearly hacking it off. When he falls in agony you finish him off with your sword.\n\nThe one staggering around with damaged man part, finally recovers, but attempts to disappear again. You throw your dagger at him as he begins to turn invisible, impaling him in the stomach. Meanwhile it appears that Captain Gruz is taking care of the one who was shooting bolts at you.\n\n\u201cBastard!\u201d he says with his boot on the shadow and chopping the shadow\u2019s head in two with his axe. Blood and brains splatter everywhere.\n\nYou move around and scan the area cautiously and try to see if there\u2019s any more shadows lurking about, but if there were they would\u2019ve either attack you by now or run off. When you\u2019re confident that none are left you walk over to Gerald who is dead already.\n\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d you shout while kicking a nearby piece of clumped up mud. You don\u2019t feel sadness this time so much as you feel frustration. All those years he was performing commando raids in Felkan territory and he gets killed like this? Not even in close combat! Somehow it doesn\u2019t seem right. Just like how Roldan died. You search Gerald\u2019s body and find the letter he was planning on sending Brenda about Roldan, it seems you will have to do it now. Perhaps even alter it.\n\nCaptain Gruz walks over to you, he has a few bolts in him, but he doesn\u2019t seem particularly bothered by them.\n\n\u201cFeh, I\u2019ve had way worse than this.\u201d He says as he pulls them out. \u201cY\u2019know we\u2019re on our own now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m saying these bolts, they ain\u2019t Shadow Guard, these are dark elven quality. That fucker over there with his head cleaved in two had one of those fancy repeating dark elven crossbows too. And while I know dark elves to be treacherous bitches that\u2019ll switch sides to whoever\u2019s paying the most, they would NEVER allow anyone to use their equipment. My guess is those mercs that were going to meet us are all dead, well either that or they ran off.\u201d\n\u201cGood, I want to kill the rest of these shadows anyway.\u201d You say and proceed on to the ruins.\n\nYour next step of your journey confirms Gruz\u2019s theory. You and he see signs of battle on your way to the ruins. Several of the bodies are dark elven, but an equal amount are Shadow Guard.\n\n\u201cLooks like they were ambushed. Heh, pretty hard to do with dark elves. Still, it also looks like the dark elves gave the shadows a hell of a fight. Looks like those are the ruins up ahead. I\u2019m guessing there probably aren\u2019t too many left, this should be over pretty quick.\u201d\n\nYou and Gruz dispense with caution and boldly march into the ruins. You both look around as the crumbling statues of old forgotten gods loom over you. Eventually you find who you\u2019re looking for in the remains of a temple that\u2019s covered in vines and partially sinking into the swamp\n\nA single Shadow Guard stands over the bodies of several others of his kind. Near the bodies are empty flasks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be with you soon my brothers and sisters. And especially you Draven.\u201d Cyrus says looking at the bodies and ignoring you completely.\n\u201cAw, how sweet. Glad you decided not to pussy out like the rest of your buddies by poisoning yourself and are at least are willing to face your death like a man.\u201d Gruz replies.\n\u201cYes, well it still remains to be seen Gruz. Though speaking of being a man, I\u2019m impressed that you actually showed up here. I thought that you would\u2019ve continued to hide and try to keep your involvement of these events a secret as you have for all these years.\u201d\n\nThis statement from Cyrus causes you to pause and look at Gruz. He looks guilty of something for a moment and then gives a toothy smile.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding Cyrus. I was waiting. Waiting until the day when I could finally track you down. It wasn\u2019t my fuck up that got us into this mess. We could\u2019ve been strong enough together to make a break from the Empire if you hadn\u2019t decided to backstab us at Fort Destiny to save your own skin. Hah! See how well that turned out. Look at you now.\u201d\n\nEven as jaded as you have become about the Empire, you are somewhat surprised about Captain Gruz\u2026but in retrospect, somebody had to have some sort of input on having all those orcs transferred to Fort Defiance. Despite this revelation you\u2019re too numb to excessively care. All you know is over the past few days you\u2019ve seen two of your fellow Eternals die ignobly while doing their duty for the Empire. Something these traitors have obviously disregarded a long time ago.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s it gonna be lad? You killin\u2019 me or the shadow first?\u201d Gruz asks.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with the original plan. We\u2019ll kill the shadow together, then you and me are going to settle up.\u201d You say calmly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit boy!\u201d Gruz laughs and steps towards Cyrus.\n\nCyrus makes no more small talk or last minute threats. He focuses purely on combat. You expect him to use his Shadow Guard tricks like poison or invisibility, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\nHe easily dodges Gruz\u2019s powerful yet clumsy attacks and lands a few well placed strikes on him, but Gruz shrugs them off like you\u2019ve seen him do the whole time you\u2019ve been fighting along side him. You can only imagine what an unstoppable juggernaut he must\u2019ve been back in his younger days.\n\nAs for you, you match Cyrus in sword skill. Whatever he learned from the Shadow Guard won\u2019t help him in a face-to-face battle with you. All it takes is for you to take advantage of his divided concentration and you land a mortal blow, slicing his side clean open.\n\nCyrus falls and deflects your attempt to split his head open, but he drops his sword from the force of your blow in the process. Weaponless, tired and bleeding out from a deep hole in his side, Cyrus accepts defeat.\n\n\u201cDo it. Eternal slave of the Empire.\u201d He says coldly and then you fulfill his request by decapitating him.\n\nYou quickly turn to face Gruz, who already has his axe ready.\n\n\u201cAlright Eternal, let\u2019s finish this.\u201d\n\nYou and Gruz clash weapons. As you battle, you\u2019re reminded of the times when you were still a child and how he taught you to fight.\nCLANG!\nHow he told you to keep a calm head in battle.\nTING!\nHow he told you to serve the Empire.\nSHING!\nHow he had confidence in your skills.\nCLANK!\nHow he saw you as a leader.\nCLANK!\nHow he told you not to die for the Emperor\u2026but to make the other dumb bastard die so that you could continue serving the Emperor\n\nSWIPE! SLICE! SLISH! SLISH! SLASH!\n\nHow he told you that failure wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nGruz finally succumbs to his multiple wounds and falls to one knee leaning on his axe in an effort not to completely collapse.\n\n\u201cDamn\u2026shit\u2026.\u201d Gruz gasps as he breathes heavily and feels his strength completely leaving him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d you ask him.\n\u201cWhy? Heh heh.\u201d Chuckles a bit while at the same time coughing up some blood. \u201cAfter all you\u2019ve experienced in your service of the Empire, you have to ask me why? My people had already been tamed and conquered decades ago and I bought into the same bullshit you did when I was a little green snot that didn\u2019t know any better. I worked my way up the ranks and did pretty good for myself, but for what? To be a lap dog that begged for a treat every time I did something right and get slapped down because I was rising too much above my so called station? I was still holding on to an idea that was long gone or never existed to begin with. It wasn\u2019t until shortly after your training was complete that I started to seriously change my mind. The Felkan war and the conspiracy that the Shadow Guard came up with just made it easier\u2026 I think I\u2019m gonna just lay down for a while.\u201d Gruz says as he loses his last battle with staying conscious.\n\nYou step towards him with your sword ready to strike, but instead you just watch him slowly drift off and hear his last words.\n\n\u201cI lived a lot longer than I should have. This is a good death for an orc. I\u2019ve seen your new replacements Eternal. They\u2019re monsters. They\u2019ll finish off what\u2019s left of this decaying husk of an Empire, not save it. Good riddance. Heh, don\u2019t worry though; you\u2019ll probably survive the coming shit storm. You\u2019ll outlive everyone.\u201d He says and then finally dies.\n\nWith the way things have been going lately, Gruz may be correct. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make you feel any better though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 35\n\nAnother rebellion put down. You wipe your sword of blood and shake your head as you look around at the chaos. This is the Quala province, the very heartland of the Empire. You shouldn\u2019t have to be trying to maintain order here only a few miles away from the capital itself.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha! Come on bitch, give it up! I\u2019m an Eternal, you oughta be flattered that I\u2019m even wasting my time on your normal ass!\u201d private Felding says as he attempts to rape a nearby girl.\n\nYou briskly walk over to Felding and pull him off her. You know damn well that the rest of his kind are probably doing stuff like this all over the place, but this one is in your direct sight and under your command.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell, captain? If you wanted first dibs you could\u2019ve just said so! Ah look, now she\u2019s getting away!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to maintain order private, not create more chaos.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? Coulda fooled me by destroying the entire town like this.\u201d\n\u201cRegrettable, but during battle only victory matters.\u201d\n\u201cExactly! We won! So now it\u2019s time to have our fun with these disobedient peasants. Y\u2019know instill fear in them so they won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not instilling fear though, you\u2019re just satisfying your own desires.\u201d\n\u201cHey, who says we aren\u2019t supposed to have fun while doing it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like talking to a brick wall. You\u2019ve had these \u201cNew Eternals\u201d under your command for a few months now and they are some of the most undisciplined troops you\u2019ve ever had. You can try to encourage them, you can try to reason with them, you can punish them, and none of it has a real effect. The only constant is that they know of your reputation and know that you\u2019re also an Eternal, which makes them just fearful of you enough that they don\u2019t attempt to directly challenge your authority like they have with so many of their other commanders.\n\nIf it were up to you, you would\u2019ve had them all killed for treason as soon as they murdered their first CO, but for whatever reason the Empire wants them active. You\u2019re guessing because the Empire\u2019s desperate. So they were ultimately transferred to you and unfortunately you\u2019re not allowed to kill them either\u2026well unless they try to kill you first.\n\nYou swear this must be what it\u2019s like to be a svelk.\n\nThey are like children, malicious hateful little children. It\u2019s not even their suspect loyalty that baffles you; it\u2019s their complete lack of discipline. Even Kane and Cyrus who opposed you had discipline. Hell, Edgar who was arguably the most emotional and hotheaded of the group was a hundred times more disciplined than any of these new \u201cEternals.\u201d You remember back to your own training and there were a few of your fellows that didn\u2019t learn proper discipline either. They never made it past Mistress and the few that did, didn\u2019t survive Gruz. Whoever was in charge of their training did a horrible job and should\u2019ve been executed for incompetence along with the rest of these vicious monsters. That old orc was right, they will destroy what\u2019s left of the Empire, but you doubt if they\u2019ll survive long after its downfall.\n\nYou think back to all the real Eternals. You, Edgar and Brenda are the only ones left, as Warrick killed in the final days of the Felkan War. At least you assume that\u2019s what happened, his body was never found and you know he would\u2019ve rather died than let himself be captured to rot in a P.O.W. Camp. Either way it\u2019s truly a loss you never ever got to talk with him again.\n\nFrom what you know Edgar is still stationed in the Arat province, probably trying to keep his own \u201ceternals\u201d in line to keep the peace there. As for poor Brenda you know she has her command in the Nalin province and probably still quietly grieving for Roldan.\n\nAfter all you\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s come to this and you\u2019re wondering what the hell you\u2019re still fighting for. The Emperor? You haven\u2019t cared about that unknown ruler for years. For all you know he\u2019s some feeble minded inbred idiot figure head that his advisors keep locked away while they bumble around ruling things probably about as well as he would.\n\nThe Empire? Perhaps at one time, but as it has lost territory, respect and apparently all resemblance of sanity over the years you\u2019ve lost all faith that it can ever regain any sort of glory it might have had, if it ever had it to begin with. You\u2019ve tried your best to stem back the tide of chaos, but you\u2019re only one man even if you are an Eternal.\n\nWhile you ponder your potential future, private Felding interrupts you.\n\n\u201cHey, cap? You\u2019re in a bit of a daze there. So if you\u2019re done I\u2019m going to go now.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, I have one more thing to tell you.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) What?\u201d Felding says with an exasperated tone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a fucking Eternal. None of you little shits are.\u201d You say and run Felding through and pull up on the sword unleashing his blood and guts onto the ground. Felding makes a high pitched scream and slumps on top of his entrails after you remove the sword.\n\n\u201cShit! The cap just killed Felding!\u201d another so called eternal shouts while he and his buddy have just come back from looting some farmer\u2019s home. The pair of them look like they want to run, but you make it easy on them.\n\n\u201cGo ahead and run or stay. I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m leaving. I will tell you this though, if the Empire sends any of you unruly scum after me, know that I shall take great pleasure in not just killing you, but in drawing it out for as long as possible. Remember this.\u201d\n\nAnd with that last warning, you leave your service to the Empire.\n\nThe question now is, where will you go? What will you do? This all feels so wrong when you think about it. You\u2019ve killed so many for abandoning, opposing, or attempting to betray the Empire and here you are doing the same thing. Was it all for nothing? Was it worth it?\n\nYou don\u2019t know. You always believed at the time you were right and that you were doing the right thing. Maybe you were, maybe you weren\u2019t. You just know that you can\u2019t serve something you don\u2019t believe in anymore. Especially when everyone else around you doesn\u2019t either.\n\nSpeaking of not knowing, you don\u2019t know how to do anything except kill people. While you\u2019re certain that you\u2019d be able to hire your skills out somewhere, the idea of being a mercenary is a little distasteful for you. You\u2019d rather not push the svelk comparison that far.\n\nYou could swear loyalty to another government you suppose. Perhaps the Felkan Kingdom? You\u2019re not sure they\u2019d want you, what with all their high tech weapons and your own government once fighting against them.\n\nThe only other alternative for you is to carve out your own territory and rule it as your own. While it\u2019s true you do have leadership qualities, you know nothing of actually running a government. You honestly wouldn\u2019t know where to begin.", "action_results": [{"action": "Become a mercenary", "result": "You have no desire to serve another government that\u2019s likely to be just as corrupt and useless as the one you served. You don\u2019t really feel like carving out your own territory either, what could you gain, the petty power thrill of being another tyrant with delusions of grandeur? You\u2019ve seen that story play out several times and it hasn\u2019t gotten the people who pursued it anywhere.\n\nMaybe the svelk had it right. Ultimately serve nobody, but yourself. After all you\u2019ve pretty much had to do that most of the time since the Empire rarely ever saw fit to help you out in any meaningful manner. The question is where can you find work as a mercenary without needing to work for any sort of government. You then remember, Rask.\n\nThe Rask territory completely broke off from the Empire and declared itself independent years ago. No attempt has been made to retake it either, as far as you know Fort Destiny was just completely abandoned. The towns there have banded together as a loose alliance for protection and trade, but nothing more than that. Despite this, they still have need for warriors and such to defend against the many monsters that lurk in the wilderness.\n\nSounds like a perfect place for you to earn a living and you\u2019re already are quite familiar with the area. You find a nearby horse and set off for the north. Along the way you see the landscape of the Empire, which at one time was orderly and even idyllic is now burning and in tatters. Despite the chaos you don\u2019t need to do any battle, not even when passing groups of angry peasants who are taking every opportunity to get revenge on their oppressive government and its agents in all forms. You can only assume your reputation is enough to scare them off or they don\u2019t even recognize you. If it\u2019s the latter then it only confirms your belief that you weren\u2019t making that much of a difference in the Empire anyway.\n\nWhen you eventually make it to the Rask borders the cold chill and snow are almost welcoming to you. As bad as it was here at times, this harsh place is probably the closest you can call home now, you only hope you can still make one here without too much problem.\n\nA few miles in and you see Fort Destiny in the distance, it looks about the same. You wonder what it\u2019s being used for now, but you see several young men standing around outside, they look like guards. You approach and are stopped.\n\n\u201cHalt, this is Kenneth\u2019s Rest. If you\u2019re here to trade then you may enter, but don\u2019t cause any trouble or you\u2019ll find yourself in more than you bargained for!\u201d a young guard says. He\u2019s wearing a patchwork Empire uniform, all of them are. You wonder if these were young recruits that just stayed when the Empire abandoned the place. If so then there are probably others as well, in fact the name Kenneth sounds familiar, but you can\u2019t place it. In any case you could do with a small break so you decide to stop here, you also figure this would be as good a place as any to start looking for work.\n\nYou tell the young man that you are not here to cause trouble, but to look for work. The young guard tells you that you might want to look for Kenneth as he usually needs various jobs done. He says he\u2019s usually found at the inn that being where he keeps his office.\n\nYou enter the fort and see that it has changed quite a bit with various traders selling and buying with each other in the courtyard. It still seems to have most of its defensive siege weapons, though they look like they\u2019re in disrepair. You notice there are still guards patrolling the top walkways, though significantly less than when this place was still a military installation. It is at this time an older guard patrolling in the crowds sees you.\n\n\u201cHey! I know you! It\u2019s the Bane of Rask!\u201d he shouts.\n\nWith this call, everyone else now turns to you. Some of the other older guards with long memories begin to realize it\u2019s you as well and move in to advance with their halberds. The younger guards who never served under you do likewise, but from their own hesitation its apparent that stories about you have been told. One of the guards whispers to another who runs off.\n\nYou take all this in stride; you figure that they believe you\u2019re here to punish them all for desertion or treason. Amusing, since at one time that would\u2019ve been true, but you\u2019re actually here for the same reason.\n\n\u201cAlright you just get off that horse slowly. We don\u2019t want any trouble, we\u2019re just trying to make a new life for ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that, but if I have to get off my horse for any reason, I promise you it won\u2019t be in your best interest that I do so. I\u2019m not here to cause trouble anyway. I just want to talk to Kenneth, I heard he\u2019s the one who has several jobs that need done.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a trick to me.\u201d One of the younger guards says.\n\u201cI assure you as any of the men that have served under me here can attest to, I do not trick. How about I just wait here for Kenneth and the rest of you go about your business\u2026 or continue to hold your weapons pointed at my direction if you believe it will make you any safer. That\u2019s fine too.\u201d\n\nYou wait a few minutes still on your horse, hoping you don\u2019t need to turn this place into a bloodbath, and then Kenneth finally appears. That\u2019s when you suddenly remember the name.\n\n\u201cLieutenant Verant! I knew the name Kenneth sounded familiar. Just forgot it was your first name, never having called you by it on a regular basis and all.\u201d You remark. Kenneth looks like he\u2019s about to collapse from fear.\n\n\u201cOh shit. Now look sir, we can explain all this. I mean\u2026we thought\u2026uh\u2026\u201d\n\nYou hold up your hand for him to stop before he has a heart attack.\n\n\u201cVerant\u2026Kenneth. There is nothing you can say that could possibly prevent you and everyone here executed for treason to the Empire. Fortunately for you, I am no longer in the service of the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I am shall we say a free agent and looking for a way to put my combat skills to use.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cHow about saying that you have some work for me?\u201d\n\nAnd so your career as a mercenary begins\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Chapter 3A1: Bane of Rask\n\n\nYear 45\n\n\u201cBastard!\u201d you say landing a killing blow on the last auravrax.\n\nYou do a double check of the cave just to make sure you\u2019ve got all the beasts. It\u2019s times like this you\u2019re reminded of your kobold hunting days. Of course auravraxes are a lot furrier and stupider. Doesn\u2019t make them any less dangerous though considering they\u2019re basically balls of hair with lots of teeth and a vicious streak a mile wide. You wonder how it was you never encountered them before when you were posted up here. You can only assume that the larger creatures like ogres and wendigos kept them in check. Thanks to your depletion of such creatures other predators managed to gain better dominance. Nature is wonderful at balancing things out that way.\n\nAfter making a check you pile up the bodies and start skinning. You figure between the payment for this job and the sale you\u2019ll make on the pelts you\u2019ll have enough money for at least of week\u2019s worth of wine, women and song.\n\n\u201cNah, to hell with the song. More women.\u201d You chuckle to yourself.\n\nThoughts about such \u201ccommon\u201d pleasures would\u2019ve never entered your head decades ago. Makes you realize how much you\u2019re changed since then, but it\u2019s a good change you think. For the first time, you\u2019ve actually been enjoying life rather than just going through the motions of it like a golem. Life is so much simpler and easier when you don\u2019t have anyone to answer to; especially when that \u201csomeone\u201d doesn\u2019t even know what the fuck they\u2019re doing half of the time. Life of course still has its bad moments, but compared to your time serving the Empire, it\u2019s like a non-stop party.\n\nThe Empire, now just another government resigned to the trash heap of history. All of its years of power and whatever glory it claimed it had completely gone. And of course much like Mother Nature, the smaller predators get to take their chance in the sun now that the big one is extinct. One of those smaller predators being one your old fellow Eternals, Edgar.\n\nYou don\u2019t know all the details, but from the rumors you\u2019ve heard he\u2019s declared himself a general and is calling the territory in his control, The Eternal Dominion. He apparently managed to get some of those chaotic eternal wannabes in some semblance of order to help him as well. When you first heard about this you could only shake your head in disappointment. Not even so much for what he\u2019s doing, but more with how he\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s going down the same path that Kane did, but with even less planning and followers that are probably more duplicitous than Shadow Guards. You\u2019d think that he would\u2019ve learned something from that mess.\n\nStill, it\u2019s his life and you have yours. You stop reminiscing about the past and concentrate on skinning the auravraxes. When you\u2019re finished you cook up one of them to eat and then get some sleep. The next day you set off to Keplavisk with your furs.\n\nWhen you get to Keplavisk, the usual people acknowledge you. Some are friendly, some aren\u2019t, and others with longer memories hate your guts for your action when you were trying to maintain order here a long time ago. Just one of the things you have to put up with, after all you still have your reputation of being\u2026\n\n\u201cBane of Rask! Bane of Rask! Hey wait up!\u201d Ulivik yells.\n\u201c(Sigh) Boy, I told you to stop calling me by that ridiculous name. In fact I told you to stop following me period!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Mr. Bane. Hey are those auravrax furs? Did you kill all of them? I bet you just went in and totally destroyed them without fear!\u201d Ulivik says while making sword whooshing sounds.\n\nYou roll your eyes at the teenager\u2019s over enthusiasm and resign yourself to him following you while you head to the town hall. For whatever reason he sees you as some sort of brave \u201chero\u201d though you wish he wouldn\u2019t. You can\u2019t get too mad at him though, not his fault he\u2019s a dark elf brought up by humans. There\u2019s got to be a lot of confusion going on there.\n\nYou mostly ignore Ulivik\u2019s incessant questioning until you get to the town hall where upon his guard run him off with racial slurs and threats. You enter the building and see the mayor. Mayor Stundle is sitting his fat ass at his desk doing nothing of any importance as usual.\n\n\u201cAh Mr. Bane, I can see by the numerous pelts you\u2019re carrying that you\u2019ve taken care of the problem, I knew you would. That\u2019s why you\u2019re the best merc in the Confederation. Your payment is on the desk there.\u201d\n\u201cGood, and my name isn\u2019t Bane you know. I keep telling people that.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed it may not be, but that\u2019s what everyone knows you as. Can\u2019t fight fame or maybe in your case infamy. Heh heh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, anyway I showed you the proof, I\u2019ve got some furs to sell.\u201d\n\u201cGot a special job for you if you want.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe later, I\u2019m going to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but I can\u2019t promise you it\u2019ll be available when you get back.\u201d\n\nAs you leave Mayor Stundle\u2019s office, Flog is just entering with several ogre scalps. He displays his obvious dislike of you as usual. As thorough as you were when you destroyed Fort Defiance, Flog survived because he did the smart thing of running away and hiding as soon as he saw your army approaching.\n\n\u201cOutta da way Bane, Flog has to see fat mayor!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s all yours.\u201d You remark not really wanting to deal with his attitude today, of course in typical orc fashion, Flog feels the need to press the issue. He sees the auravrax furs and makes his move.\n\u201cGruh. You kill little furry things. Flog kill big ogres! More proof that Flog better merc than you!\u201d\n\u201cSure Flog, whatever.\u201d You say dismissively which of course annoys Flog even more.\n\u201cFlog gonna kill you one day Bane!\u201d he shouts as you walk away.\n\u201cSure Flog, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d You say almost yawning. Another time and place you would\u2019ve killed him for speaking to you in such a manner, but over the years you\u2019ve mellowed with age. Besides he\u2019s been threatening to kill you for the last eight years. The first few times you took him seriously. Now it\u2019s just boring. If he really ever wants to try he knows where to find you, not like you\u2019re hiding.\n\nAfter selling your furs you make you take your money to the closest tavern where you proceed to make good on your claim of relaxing. After a couple days of carousing you\u2019re lying in bed with a couple of serving wenches and you decide that you should probably get back to work. No point in waiting around until all your coin is gone, you\u2019ve had your fun now its time to get back to what you\u2019re really good at, killing stuff. You tell the girls in your room to leave and get prepared to go find some more work.\n\nYou\u2019ve barely stepped out of the inn and Ulivik has already found you and nearly gets himself stabbed for sneaking up on you.\n\n\u201cHey Mr. Bane, it\u2019s just me!\u201d he says with a worried tone.\n\u201cBoy, didn\u2019t I tell you to never sneak up on me like that? I could\u2019ve killed you and I doubt if anyone would\u2019ve blamed me for it!\u201d you shout\n\u201cSorry, Mr. Bane. Hey are you going on another mission?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think you are! But Mayor Stundle already gave out all of the jobs, you\u2019ll probably have to go to another town.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you know this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I tried to sign up, but I got thrown out of the town hall and called names.\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right, but how did you get in there in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cI snuck in. I think I\u2019m getting really good at it!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, sounds like your svelk heritage is finally paying off.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSvelk?\u201d Ulivik asks as if you\u2019ve spoken a made up word.\n\u201cSvelk, you know it\u2019s the proper name for you dark elves, you mean you\u2019ve never heard the term?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been called a dark elf before, but I mostly get called a lot of other names.\u201d\n\u201cWell life\u2019s tough kid, now you go run along\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey why don\u2019t I come with you on your next mission!?\u201d\n\nAnd there it is. You knew the day was coming where he\u2019d start asking you to bring him with you.\n\n\u201cYeah, no. I work alone.\u201d\n\u201cAw come on! I need the experience! I try to sign up for even the easy jobs and I get thrown out! I\u2019ve even tried going door to door asking if there are any monsters they need killing and they usually just say, yeah the one standing front of me! Then they slam the door in my face! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you want to be a merc anyway? I mean I know you\u2019ve got a family that takes care of you. They must, if they were willing to take on the ostracizing that would come in raising a dark elf baby.\u201d\n\u201cThey do and I know they love me, but working as a hide tanner is boring! I want to be a mercenary and live a life of adventure! I mean I\u2019ve heard stories of how my race is composed of nothing but mercenaries! Just think, a long proud line of brave ancestors that lived a glorious life of excitement! I should be as noble as them!\u201d\n\nYou almost laugh when hearing how Ulivik has spoken of his race. He truly is out of touch as there is absolutely nothing glorious, proud or noble about them. Even brave is debatable most of the time.\n\n\u201cUlivik, if you really want to be a merc, why not just go to Kenneth\u2019s Rest? He doesn\u2019t give a shit who he hires. Hell, he hires dark elves on a regular basis.\u201d\n\u201cI would, but uh, I\u2019m not allowed to leave the town\u2026but I know if you were with me, my parents would let me go! So can I please come with you?!\u201d\n\nThis scenario is just so bizarre; you hardly believe that it\u2019s happening, a dark elf practically begging you to teach him to be a mercenary. The crazy thing about all this is you\u2019re actually considering it. You must finally be suffering from some of the blows you\u2019ve taken to the head in the past. It\u2019s the only explanation.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take Ulivik with you", "result": "You decide to humor the boy and agree. Chances are, he\u2019s not going to get permission from his parents anyway and when that happens he\u2019ll be less likely to bother you again. If he does get permission, well it\u2019s not that far to Kenneth\u2019s Rest and you were going there anyway. Plus you\u2019ll have given him the chance he wants and again he\u2019ll be less likely to bother you.\n\n\u201cAlright Ulivik, you go ask your parents, but I\u2019m taking you to Kenneth\u2019s Rest and no further. And when we get there, you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to be tagging along with me anywhere else.\u201d\n\u201cOkay! That\u2019s great! I\u2019ll be right be back\u2026uh could you come with me, so they know I\u2019m telling the truth?\u201d\n\u201cOh fer\u2026fine.\u201d\n\nYou follow Ulivik back to his parent\u2019s store which smells heavily of leather. The pair of them are working on some sort of the hide when you both walk in.\n\n\u201cMom! Dad! Mr. Bane said he\u2019d take me to Kenneth\u2019s Rest and teach me to be a mercenary! So can I go now?\u201d\n\u201cHey wait I never said I\u2019d teach\u2026\u201d you start to say before Ulivik\u2019s dad interjects his own comments.\n\u201cOh is that right? And how do you know that? How do you know he won\u2019t just rob and kill you along some lonely road?\u201d\n\u201cOr worse!\u201d his mother says.\n\u201cHey wait a minute now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t fair! You said if I could find somebody to teach me, that you\u2019d allow me to go!\u201d Ulivik whines.\n\u201cYeah, well we didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually be successful, let alone get a cold hearted killer like Bane here to agree. Which makes me wonder why he did\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, at this point I\u2019m wondering the same thing.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cUlivik, why can\u2019t you just be interested in the family business? It\u2019s a more honorable profession than being a mercenary. It\u2019s honest work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and the workin\u2019 man is a sucker! Look at where we live!\u201d\n\u201cHey! We get by just fine, and this business has put food in your belly, clothes on your back and a roof over your head! So don\u2019t you dare bad mouth this proud family tradition!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not really your son anyway! And you\u2019re not my real parents! I hate this place and every here hates me!\u201d Ulivik screams and leaves slamming the door.\n\nYou\u2019re left in an awkward situation with his parents.\n\n\u201cOkay, so I guess that settles that, I\u2019ll just be going now\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cNo, you get back here you sonofabitch.\u201d Ulivik\u2019s dad says.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cI called you a sonofabitch, now if you want to kill me for that you can do it after hearing what I\u2019ve got to say first.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, okay. It\u2019s been a weird sort of day today anyway, I\u2019ll play.\u201d You say with a smile.\n\u201cYeah, well I ain\u2019t playing. Look, I know all about you, and you probably don\u2019t know me at all but I remember your ruthless reputation when you were still in service of the Empire. There was a family that lived down the block from me and my wife. We we\u2019re friends and they even had a couple of children. Children that we would sometimes love to entertain because we couldn\u2019t have any of our own. But this family wasn\u2019t happy with the Empire\u2019s rules so they along with several others protested\u2026\u201d\n\nYou stop the tanner right there.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know what you\u2019re going to say, I had them all killed for treason and had their heads put on pikes. Well I was trying to maintain order and I did what I had to do to get the job done. I\u2019m sure this story pales in comparison to others have screamed at me in the past and you don\u2019t even need to make your point about hating me, because I\u2019m used to it anyway. Besides you don\u2019t want your son going to Kenneth\u2019s Rest and I\u2019m certainly not going to drag him along. If anything I\u2019d wish he\u2019d stop looking up to me as some sort of hero and following me around. I was hoping by doing this for him I\u2019d finally be rid of him. So if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll be going now and I\u2019ll also be disappointing you again, by not killing you before I leave.\u201d\n\nYou turn to leave and that\u2019s when you get another unusual request.\n\n\u201cIf you take him to Kenneth\u2019s Rest, will you also look after him?\u201d Ulivik\u2019s mother asks.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cIf you want money to do so, we can pay. Just can you look after him for a while at least?\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026now I\u2019m confused. I thought not only did you not want him to go, but that I was also a ruthless bastard that would probably rob and kill him along a lonely road?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t want him to go, and yeah you are a ruthless bastard\u2026but I also know you actually do have some sort of code of honor. You might\u2019ve left the Empire behind, but the regimented way of thinking you have is still there. You wouldn\u2019t bother killing my boy unless you felt he was a direct danger to you, and I think we both know that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d Ulivik\u2019s dad says.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\u201cThe other thing is\u2026we\u2019re not going to be able to stop him. He\u2019s been getting more and more restless about this, and he\u2019s going to want to pursue this career path whether we want him to or not. At this point he\u2019s just going to run away from home and who knows what trouble he\u2019ll get into. (sigh) Maybe it\u2019s just his nature, bein\u2019 a dark elf and all, but for good or ill, me and my wife have taken on the responsibility of raising him. And part of that is making sure he has the survival skills that he\u2019ll need to make it in this world. We can\u2019t teach him that, but you could. Look, like my wife said, we can pay you a good sum just for you teach him the basics, or whatever else is involved, if you need more, I dunno we\u2019ll try to figure out something.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re speechless for a moment. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen the worst in people, something like this happens and surprises you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you expect me to do. I mean this job isn\u2019t something I can teach like from a book. Most of what he\u2019s going to have to learn is going to be from direct experience. I mean I suppose I could teach him some combat skills, but the rest is going to mainly be up to him.\u201d\n\u201cWell do what you can, and take this in the meantime.\u201d\n\nUliviki\u2019s mother hands you a small bag. When you look inside, it\u2019s nothing but gold coins. This has to be some of their savings, possibly all of their savings. They must really trust you, if they\u2019ve given you this much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. You have my word as an Eternal.\u201d You say and pocket the bag of coins. With those last words you exit the tanner\u2019s store intending to find Ulivik. Fortunately you know he isn\u2019t far.\n\n\u201cUlivik, I know you\u2019re around the corner. Stop sulking, or pouting or whatever teenage angst you\u2019re doing and let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nUlivik slowly comes out from behind the corner.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking me with you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I scared your parents into letting you come with me. Now grab whatever gear you want to take and let\u2019s go before all the good jobs are taken.\u201d\n\nUlivik is completely giddy at this turn of events and runs back into the store to get his stuff. You on the other hand are wondering how the hell you got yourself into this. Then you feel the bag of coins again and remember.\n\nOn your journey to Kenneth\u2019s Rest, you explain to Ulivik some of the things he should know such as haggling for better prices on jobs and the art of intimidation. You also teach him a few combat moves. He\u2019s a rookie to be sure, but his agility allows him from getting hurt too badly.\n\nWhen you get to Kenneth\u2019s Rest, the place is as busy as always. Ulivik is more than a little distracted by the surroundings, and you have to keep reminding him to stay alert.\n\n\u201cHey stop staring at the harlots and pay attention! Just because fighting isn\u2019t supposed to be allowed here, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. In fact people around here love to start trouble. Don\u2019t stare at anyone in the eye for too long and make sure you don\u2019t bump into anybody. You could either get into a fight, or someone might even try to pick your pocket.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Here isn\u2019t the job board that way?\u201d\n\u201cJob board? Hah. I never use those things. I go straight to the source. Trust me, if you want to get a job that pays well; get to know and make contact with the owners or government officials. Fortunately Kenneth used to work for me at one time, so it was quite easy for me to make contact with him. And when we find him, just keep your mouth shut, and let me do all the talking.\u201d\n\nEventually you find Kennth, he\u2019s as jumpy as ever whenever you first see him.\n\n\u201cSir! I didn\u2019t expect you to be down this way so soon? What can I do for you today?\u201d\n\u201cKenneth, will you relax? It\u2019s been what, like ten years now? I\u2019m not your superior officer anymore; you don\u2019t have to keep calling me sir and getting all nervous and shit.\u201d\n\u201cI know sir, just old habits you know? Who\u2019s this with you?\u201d\n\u201cThis here is Ulivik, and he\u2019s going to be my apprentice for a while.\u201d\n\u201cApprentice? Seriously? Never pegged you as the teaching type.\u201d\n\u201cRight, Kenneth, like all those years of training soldiers in this very fort count for nothing at all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean\u2026I just oh I dunno. It\u2019s just odd I guess. He\u2019s a svelk, how come he\u2019s not with his own people?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long and unusual story, and one I don\u2019t have time to go into. Besides we\u2019re not here to satisfy your curiosity, we\u2019re here for jobs, but seeing as this is Ulivik\u2019s first time and all, can we get something maybe a little less\u2026lethal?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, usually that sort of stuff is on the boards, but I think I got something. Oh! There\u2019s a nest of auravraxes a few miles from here.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, more of those furry things? I just wiped out a nest of them a week ago!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s all I got that\u2019s on the easy side. I mean I\u2019ve got some other jobs too, but you said this was more for training your apprentice than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cI can take on a harder task Mr. Bane. I mean I have to learn from experience right?\u201d Ulivik pipes up forgetting that he was supposed to keep his mouth shut.\n\nStill, he might have a point.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take on the easy job", "result": "Ulivik might think he\u2019s ready, but he\u2019s definitely not. Killing auravraxes might be easy for you, but they\u2019ll be more than enough for him to handle. Anything harder and he may very well be killed in the blink of an eye. Normally this would just be on the job training, but you were sort of paid to look after him for a while at least.\n\n\u201cGive us the auravrax nest job.\u201d You say. Ulivik looks a little disappointed, but he doesn\u2019t speak out of turn again. Kenneth proceeds to tell you exactly where the creatures have been spotted in large quantities and the pair of you are on your way.\n\nAlong the way, you tell Ulivik how he should approach fighting these things and how not to take them lightly as they can easily take an arm off or any other limb if you aren\u2019t careful. He seems to understand the risk.\n\nAs you get closer to their nest, you begin to encounter the furry fiends. Ulivik slightly freezes up when they spot you and attack. You have to snap him out of it and take up the fighting slack.\n\n\u201cCome on kid, move in and attack! This is the moment of truth!\u201d you shout. Fortunately, this motivates him to do just that. Of course after the fight, he\u2019s got a very different view of things now. He\u2019s out of breath, his heart is racing and he\u2019s probably feeling a mix of excitement and fear, or perhaps just fear in his case.\n\n\u201cSo, is it everything you expected it to be?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI\u2026yeah, I mean no. I mean\u2026(pant) that was intense.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s about to get even more intense, we\u2019ve still got a whole bunch more to kill.\u201d\n\nThe auravrax nest is another typical hole in the ground filled with them. Standard stuff for you, but its Ulivik\u2019s true test. If he can make it through alive and in one piece, he might just have what it takes after all. You let him do most of the fighting, only intervening when it really looks like he\u2019s going to get himself eaten or when you\u2019re directly attacked. After he thinks he\u2019s killed them all, you point out that he should double check the entire dwelling just in case.\n\n\u201cWhat? But we got \u2018em all! I mean if any were still alive they would\u2019ve attacked by now.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily. A few of the smarter ones will actually find some place to hide and attack when you think you\u2019re safe and let your guard down. Trust me, you better double check. It might be boring, but this is part of the job and you will do it if you want to stay alive. And while you\u2019re at it bring the bodies of the dead ones back here for skinning. You always need proof and the furs usually fetch a good price. It\u2019s a good way to earn extra money. Off your go, and if I hear any more whining from your apprenticeship is at an end and you truly will be on your own.\u201d\n\nUlivik certainly doesn\u2019t want that, so he obeys what you tell him to do. You can sort of tell his \u201chero worship\u201d is already starting to wane a bit though, but that\u2019s good. It\u2019ll keep him grounded and show him that this isn\u2019t some glorious profession that he thinks it is. You figure after about a week of this and he\u2019ll probably be ready to go back to wanting to take up his dad\u2019s business or at least considering it.\n\nEventually after all the double checking, skinning and some sleep you head back to Kenneth\u2019s Rest.\n\n\u201cI know I asked you this earlier, but it bears repeating. Is it everything you thought it would be?\u201d\n\u201cSome of it I suppose, I dunno it\u2019s weird. Part of me almost wants to go back to take up my dad\u2019s business.\u201d He says, causing you to smile to yourself at being correct.\n\u201cWell if you want to get out, the best time to do it is when you\u2019re ahead. If you\u2019re going to stick with it though, I\u2019m going to warn you, my combat training is only going to get tougher.\u201d\n\u201cTougher? But you saw me handle myself.\u201d\n\u201cI saw you nearly get your head bitten off several times if I hadn\u2019t been there to help. And if you think if I\u2019m being mean, you have no idea what being mean really is. MY first training instructor was a sadistic svelk bitch and out of all the people I\u2019ve ever met, she still ranks number one.\u201d\n\u201cSo is this why you agreed to train me? Some sort of revenge then?\u201d Ulivik asks.\n\u201cHa ha ha! Is that what you think? If I was going to hold grudges for something like that, I\u2019d be bringing genocide to the svelk race. No, if anything she helped me survive and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do for you, assuming you even want to pursue this path. I\u2019d say you\u2019d better decide what your priorities are between now and by the time we get our payment from Kenneth.\u201d\n\nUlivik is silent for the rest of the way, makes for a nice change. Still, you are wondering if he\u2019s going to let his steadily decreasing opinion of you change his mind about being a merc. Eventually you get back to Kenneth\u2019s Rest which is busy as usual, you also run into another face you haven\u2019t seen in a while, though you weren\u2019t really missing it in the first place.\n\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t the infamous Bane of Rask, heard you were around.\u201d Eldolith remarks with her small group of svelk milling about behind her.\n\u201cEldolith, I notice your little band of cutthroats is getting smaller and smaller. Keep this up and you\u2019ll soon have no more warm bodies to hide behind and actually have to do the fighting yourself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard you acquired yourself a new one. What\u2019s wrong, human aging finally catching up with you at last Eternal? Is this him? A svelk? Hmmm he is very young, is he your pleasure boy?\u201d\n\nBefore you can reply, Ulivik steps up and speaks.\n\n\u201cI am a mercenary, like you and the rest of our kind!\u201d\n\nThis of course causes laughter among Edolith and her men.\n\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re no mercenary, let alone one of our kind following around a human like some harlot in heat. No, what you are is a poor mockery of what a svelk should be. Now be gone, your mere presence offends me.\u201d Edolith says and turns her back on you both. Ulivik nearly takes the bait, but you intervene and hold him back from getting himself killed. Eldolith and the rest of her group laugh and head to the inn.\n\n\u201cEasy, there. Words nothing more. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard worse when you were still working as a tanner.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but this is different! I\u2019m a mercenary now, not some weakling tanner!\u201d\n\u201cTo most you\u2019re still a snot nosed kid that doesn\u2019t know shit and that would be a correct assessment, especially to a svelk. Now I\u2019m sure harsh words from one of your own kind has filled you with a bruised ego, anger and disappointment, but if you try to challenge her, she\u2019d cut you down before you even knew what was happening, as would any of her men.\u201d\n\u201cWe could take them together!\u201d\n\u201cWe? No, I might be able to take them. You on the other hand would get in my way and get yourself killed. Besides I am here to train you to become a mercenary, not be your personal avenger. Part of this training is learning when to pick your battles. Now I suggest you ignore her words for now, and let us get our payment from Kenneth. Money tends to cheer most up.\u201d\n\nUlivik obeys and follows, then he asks an amusing question.\n\n\u201cIs she the svelk bitch you spoke of that trained you?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, no not her. Eldolith pales in comparison. No, she\u2019s just another arrogant svelk merc that likes to do a lot of posturing. She\u2019s actually really insecure about her leadership position. Always has been, even when she was hired by the Empire decades ago, but those are stories for another time.\u201d\n\nYou and Ulivik soon meet up with Kenneth who gives you your payment. This does cheer up Ulivik a little and soon he\u2019s forgotten Eldolith\u2019s insults. Predictably he spends most of his coin on some strumpet looking for an easy mark, she still gives him a good time though.\n\nThe next day, Ulivik\u2019s training continues as it does for at least a year after which time you figure he\u2019s ready to go out on his own. He\u2019s still a little reckless for his own good, but you can sense he really does want to be independent. His hero worship of you is gone and he may even dislike you now, but the respect is still there as it always has been.\n\nPart of you feels glad that the \u201cjob\u201d is over with, but another part of you feels a sense of loss. As strange as it may seem, you started not minding Ulivik\u2019s company. It\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve lead anybody into battle or otherwise. Ulivik may have only been one svelk trainee, but it still brought back memories of the \u201cold days\u201d. The old days, back when you had more of a purpose.\n\nIn some ways training Ulivik gave you a higher purpose than just killing for coin again. You also think back to Eldolith\u2019s words about human aging. Sure they\u2019re meaningless now, but how long can you truly keep up a mercenary life? You are definitely in better shape than most humans your age and barring violence you still probably have several years left, but the future is something you are starting to ponder about. Despite being an Eternal, you ARE still human, and from your own experience, being an Eternal does not make one immortal. Growing \u201cold\u201d is something you never considered, at one time you always figured you\u2019d just die in battle one day. That day may still come, but even you have to admit that the prospect of dying in battle no longer holds the same \u201cappeal\u201d as it once did when you were in the service of the Empire.\n\nAt one time you also wondered what other skills you had besides killing. Now you see that you haven\u2019t given yourself as much credit as you should have. You have decades of combat experience behind you, experience that you could easily pass on to others if they were willing to pay for the knowledge.\n\nYou begin to entertain the idea that maybe you should open up some sort of combat training school. The more you think about it, the more the idea appeals to you. You\u2019re going to have to remain a mercenary for quite awhile still as you attempt to gain the coin to get such a place started, and probably still go on jobs even a little afterwards, but you feel like you have a true purpose again.\n\nAnd so you set off with your new goal in mind\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 55\n\nAfter another hard day of training various citizens of Rask, you lie in your bed thinking about how much has changed over the years. Never did you think that you\u2019d be running a real business, though to be honest if it wasn\u2019t for legitimate paranoia on the part of the Rask Alliance, you\u2019d probably be spending all of your time still as a merc, as it stands you\u2019re practically responsible for training the closest thing to an army that Rask has, though it\u2019s probably more of an organized militia.\n\nIt\u2019ll be the first line of defense if the Eternal Dominion starts to look to this way for expansion. When the ED started re-conquering the old territory of the Empire it was only natural that the towns and villages of Rask started getting worried. They didn\u2019t break away from the Empire only to replace it with something similar or worse. It was just their luck (and yours) that you wanted to become a professional combat instructor. Soon people from all over Rask were coming to see you. You hardly ever have to do any sort of mercenary work anymore and the mayor of Keplavisk is overjoyed by the fact that you set up shop in his town.\n\nAs for the Eternal Dominion threat, you aren\u2019t sure what to think. There has been no formal declaration of war or even a diplomatic visit to Rask yet, but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be, Rask has lots of resources after all. Still, the ED has its hands full still trying to keep everyone in line from the top to the bottom while attempting to gain more holdings. Mass orc migration to Rask are becoming common, even the svelk are more welcome in Rask again. Partly due to the possible need for more mercs if war comes to pass and partly due to dark elves being disliked by the ED, which apparently frowns upon mercenaries (and probably the attitudes of the dark elves in general).\n\nYou have to hand it to \u201cGeneral\u201d Edgar though, you didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to get those chaotic brats calling themselves \u201ceternals\u201d organized, though it sounds like they\u2019re still as sadistic as ever and if the rumors are true, another generation of Eternals are being trained as well. You can\u2019t even imagine what they\u2019re going to be like. If war is coming like everyone thinks it is, you know immediately that you\u2019re probably going to be nominated and begged by the various mayors and council members to be some sort of commander. You aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019d accept the position though you probably will mainly because you don\u2019t want to be bothered moving anymore and you\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll live under the rule of some half assed Eternals.\n\nPart of you wonders what the hell is going through Edgar\u2019s mind. He seemed more level headed the last time you saw him, like the incident with Kane forced him to mature, but you guess his aspirations for personal glory were just too great to keep suppressed for long. You also wonder about Brenda, she\u2019s the only other old Eternal that was left, and you have no idea if she\u2019s even still alive or serving with Edgar. You get your answer and then some in a few days.\n\nAnother hard day of training various citizens of Rask and you\u2019re ready to close up shop and then two figures wearing hoods enter. You have flashbacks to fighting the Shadow Guard and you draw your sword.\n\n\u201cHold on! It\u2019s me! Warrick! See?\u201d a familiar voice says and reveals himself from under the hood. The face is much older than you remember and sporting an eye patch, and the hair is now nearly gone. But considering you thought Warrick to be dead, you aren\u2019t completely convinced until the second cloaked figure reveals herself and speaks.\n\n\u201cI told you wearing these things was a bad idea. He probably thought we were Shadow Guards!\u201d she says. Her face is also much older and the hair is completely gray, but you definitely know this one is Brenda. Between the pair of them it truly makes you realize how much time has passed since you saw them.\n\u201cAnd I told you, we need to keep a low profile, this situation is dangerous to the both of us.\u201d Warrick says.\n\n\u201cWarrick back from the dead and Brenda, I was just recently thinking about what had become of you.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to talk to you about Edgar.\u201d Warrick says cutting right to the point.\n\u201cYeah I thought so\u2026okay let me lock up and we can talk about this in my quarters.\u201d\n\nThe first thing you find out is that Warrick is now working for the Felkan Kingdom. He says it\u2019s a long story, but it has its roots in his becoming disillusioned with the Empire much like you did. Warrick also goes on to say that\u2019s one of the reasons why he\u2019s here. Edgar definitely has plans to attack it in the future and the crown hopes to avoid another long and troublesome war by recruiting allies this time. He mentions real Felkan diplomats will probably be arriving in Rask soon to speak with the leaders of the towns, but he was sent to specifically reach out to you, because whether you knew it or not, your reputation here carries weight.\n\nAs for Brenda, her position is much more dangerous. She is currently serving the Eternal Dominion, (another long story) but is trying to encourage an underground dissident movement. Not really difficult considering how oppressive Edgar\u2019s regime is. It is the hope of the Felkan Kingdom that the ED will wear itself out on keeping down riots and other potential conquests like Rask before it turns its eyes on the Felkan Kingdom.\n\nYou tell Warrick that he\u2019s probably wasted a trip as the paranoid mentality of the Raskians are already preparing for war with the ED and will have no problem allying with the Felkan Kingdom and that you\u2019ll no doubt be called upon to command the people you\u2019ve been training. Warrick seems relived to hear that, and you and he begin to do a little catching up. Brenda participates as well, though the whole time she seems a little preoccupied. Eventually as the night goes on, Warrick says he must be getting back to report to his superiors. Brenda says that she is not ready to leave as she wishes to speak to you about Roldan and his last days with you. Warrick understands, but warns her that she should not be away for too long so as to arouse suspicion. He would hate to have her sacrifices should lead to her death.\n\n\u201cSacrifices\u2026as if he would know about such things. When the Empire needed him the most what did he do? He ran to the fucking enemy. Now his new masters give him commands and the running lapdog thinks he\u2019s free, but he\u2019s still a slave.\u201d She remarks with distain, before continuing.\n\n\u201cEdgar may be an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur like he always was, but he at least tried to keep the Empire together, even if it is in a different form now. He believes in something better, even if he\u2019s not exactly intelligent enough to carry out that idea. And you, you\u2019re worst of them all. You just dropped out altogether and dedicating yourself to nothing, but coin like a fucking svelk. What the hell happened to you? You used be our leader.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what your point is, but if this all pent up anger at me due to Roldan dying I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare fucking mention him! I heard enough of hollow apologies in that damn letter you wrote to me.\u201d\n\u201cThey were Eternals as we all are. Dying in combat is always a possibility for us, I know their deaths weren\u2019t the most glorious, but at the time they died doing something they believed in. I can hardly help that the institution that they believed in, crumbled soon afterwards. I tried like hell to maintain my own belief in the Empire despite having it time after time again tested. Eventually I saw the light when I had to command a bunch of those new eternals while attempting to put down mass riots near the capital. Was leaving the right decision? I don\u2019t know, but it was for ME. The fact is ALL of our lives were nothing but duty and dedication to a corrupt government that deserved none of it. Kane knew that, Gruz knew that, and as much as I still hate them to this day, the Shadow Guard knew that. When the Empire was in its death throes it affected us all differently. I can\u2019t help the fact that you decided to stay loyal and it didn\u2019t work out resulting in you eventually having to capitulate to Edgar later on. At least you and Roldan had an experience that none of us will ever have. You have at least that to cherish.\u201d\n\nBrenda is silent for a moment as she takes in your statement. She looks at a ring on her finger, which is obviously still her wedding ring to Roldan. She smiles and then speaks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right I suppose. You usually were when we all served under you. Even you couldn\u2019t have prevented the Empire from falling, the damage was done long before we came into existence. I guess I just never got over Roldan\u2019s death and had nobody except you to blame since you were the only one still alive. The funny thing is I didn\u2019t start blaming you until I found out you left the Empire. You were always our leader, and it seemed unthinkable that you would leave willingly. You know I think none of us really saw anyone else as their leader except you. It\u2019s probably why Kane wanted you to join him, it\u2019s no doubt why Warrick insisted on reaching out to you and it\u2019s why Edgar sent me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the things you were wrong about and Warrick too. I am not helping him though he still thinks I am. There is no underground resistance, or at least none that matters. Warrick and his Felkan masters think they can undermine the Eternal Dominion, but they are quite wrong. When Edgar first came to me and explained his cause and ideas I realized it was a just and worthy one. I joined in an effort to help with some of the details that Edgar himself is not nearly as skilled at, still he has proven himself to be more charismatic than he once was, at least to the other eternals and that\u2019s who is mainly important. He wants to create a nation where we Eternals are in control, as it should\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026so why would he want me for, wouldn\u2019t he consider me an enemy like Warrick?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not like Warrick. While your abandonment did sadden Edgar, he always figured you had a good reason. He never questioned it. And now that you\u2019ve told me your views I see he was right. It\u2019s really quite odd to see how high of regard he holds you. I guess your time with him during Kane\u2019s attempted secession really impacted him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrenda, this is a lot to take in, what exactly are you expecting from me then?\u201d\n\u201cAs Warrick said, your reputation carries weight here and you have the ear of several of the mayors here. Perhaps you could explain to them that even with training that resistance will be useless and that the ED will just slaughter everyone. Better that they should surrender now and have a benevolent overseer such as\u2026you running things.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you really think Raskians are going to go for that idea?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it matter? They are going to be conquered eventually anyway. I merely suggest other options to Edgar\u2019s plan, which was to convince you to just come with me where you could take command of a battalion to conquer Rask seeing as you know the place the best.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, sounds like him. So what was the plan if I refuse altogether? Killing me I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t come up though I even asked him about it, but as I said Edgar really believes that you\u2019ll help us. Perhaps in some way he didn\u2019t want to think about the alternative. I\u2019m guessing that you are considering the alternative?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t, do you?\u201d\n\u201cYou would have a true purpose again. Serving an idea greater than yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI have a true purpose now. I\u2019m training others to fight against those that would take their lives. The Raskians don\u2019t want to be ruled over and quite frankly neither do I, let alone by Edgar.\u201d\n\u201cNo! You would be different! You, like myself would be given an equal place in the decision making process! Even the other Eternal don\u2019t get that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the other thing, I\u2019m loathed to live in a land that considers those new\u2026things, eternals.\u201d\n\u201cThey are much different now, true they still have their sadistic streak, but only towards the non-eternals and who cares about them?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the non-eternals do, and while they may very well be inferior, enough of them can topple any government. We saw it happen, and it\u2019ll happen to you too if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you saying you won\u2019t join us?\u201d\n\nYou get the impression that if you say no, she\u2019s going to attack you and you\u2019ll have to defend yourself. Killing Brenda is something you do not want to do, but lying and saying yes is duplicity you\u2019d rather not engage in.", "action_results": [{"action": "Say no", "result": "You didn\u2019t lie to Kane when he wanted you to join him and you aren\u2019t going to lie to Brenda, but you are going to try to reason with her.\n\n\u201cBrenda, I didn\u2019t join Kane all those years ago, because his path wasn\u2019t mine and I\u2019m not joining you and Edgar for the same reasons. However I would hope that we don\u2019t end up like me and him did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you think I\u2019m going to try to kill you? No, I doubt if I could by myself. I fear I probably haven\u2019t kept up my combat skills as honed as you have. To be quite honest, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to do, if you rejected the offer. I guess I\u2019ll give Edgar the bad news, but I know he\u2019s not going to take it well and he\u2019ll definitely attack this place with his army and I doubt if you\u2019ll be spared for old times sake.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to convince him not to. Look, this place is not going to bend to his will. The paranoia and the idea of freedom is stronger here than it has ever been. If you attack Rask, be prepared to suffer considerable losses as I personally will make sure of it. This is my home now. I\u2019m not leaving and I\u2019m not serving another empire either. Even if you win, you will not easily recover from the losses let alone be able to fight the Felkan Kingdom, in fact they will most likely take advantage of the chaos. Now you\u2019ve been in contact with Warrick long enough to know that the Felkan Kingdom is counting on you being disorganized and weak from attacking Rask. If you want to play it smart? Attack them instead and don\u2019t worry about Rask.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s stopping Rask from attacking us if they ally with the Felkan Kingdom?\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t trust me. The Felkan Kingdom can send all the diplomats they want, but the Raskians are ultimately not going to stick their necks out for them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think Edgar will go for this idea?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what? He\u2019ll go for it, because if he TRULY respects me, he\u2019ll fucking listen to my advice which has never steered him wrong, not to mention I saved his damn life more than once. I\u2019m telling you to tell him, that he needs to consolidate his forces, get his house in order, maybe retake a few other areas of the old Empire and THEN attack the Felkan Kingdom if he absolutely needs to. Rask is just death zone, it didn\u2019t do the Empire any good and they only held on to it for as long as they did because I was here. I say that not as a boast, but as truth. Does Edgar have anyone like me in his army? I doubt it. The hostile inhabitants here didn\u2019t call me the Bane of Rask for nothing. A name, which I\u2019m still called, even by those I\u2019m helping. If he sets an army in these lands, I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ll start calling me the Bane of Edgar.\u201d\n\nBrenda smiles a bit again at your last remark.\n\n\u201cYou always did have a way with words. I missed that sometimes. Okay, well I guess I\u2019ll go then, to deliver your message.\u201d\n\u201cBrenda y\u2019know there is another option. You could stay here, or go somewhere else. You don\u2019t need to follow Edgar. You\u2019re fully capable of doing something else with your life.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s tempting. I even thought about joining Warrick when he first approached me, but it\u2019s not for me. Warrick\u2019s path to me is one of a traitor, even if I do understand it and your path is one of freedom\u2026something I guess I just can\u2019t comprehend. I still need the structure and hierarchy. I dunno, maybe I just need to be with other likeminded Eternals. None of them are Roldan, but I don\u2019t feel as lonely.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is at last. The real reason why Brenda is following Edgar, you knew it couldn\u2019t be because she blindly believed in his cause. You can\u2019t imagine what is going on in her head and there will be no talking her out of her choice, but you\u2019re glad you won\u2019t have to fight her and hopefully her message to Edgar will get through to him as well. You bid farewell to Brenda, probably for the last time. You go to bed that night, but you don\u2019t really sleep, you just wonder what events the coming months will hold.\n\nMonths pass and just as Warrick said, diplomats from the Felkan Kingdom visit Rask. As you thought, they get a lot of promises of an alliance and some trade deals, but that\u2019s about it. The general consensus of the Raskians is that they won\u2019t be committing any troops unless war comes directly to their doorsteps. Great, now you just hope that Edgar follows your advice\u2026\n\nYear 58\n\nEdgar took your advice, or at least you guess he did. He never attacked Rask. Never even sent anyone, he did however send thousands across the Felkan borders a couple years ago. The war is still going on and you hear it\u2019s even more brutal than the one with the Empire. Edgar has adapted with the times unlike the Empire and is implementing stolen technology from the Felkans. You can only imagine how Warrick is faring and while it is unfortunate, you stopped being their \u201cleader\u201d decades ago and their motives, goals and dreams are their own concerns not yours.\n\nAnd your only concern lately is getting old. Every day you notice new pains in your joints and muscles. You\u2019re slower than you once were and not quite as strong anymore. You wonder how your fellow Eternals feel about getting old, though perhaps due to still being engaged in warfare, maybe they don\u2019t dwell on it as much. Brenda and Warrick will probably expect to die in battle, as for Edgar, the fool probably believes he\u2019ll live forever.\n\nYou don\u2019t have as many students anymore, as many of the other towns have taken to creating their own combat schools, mostly run by those you taught. Mercenary work is even harder to come by nowadays; thanks to you each town actually has competent militias that can clean out hostiles without much mercenary aid anymore. Indeed they need something to do considering Edgar never attacked Rask.\n\nEven the ogre tribes in the far north have settled down. Last you heard, Flog \u201cretired\u201d at one of their primitive villages, a forced wedding to an ogre bride for killing her husband to be. Bet he wishes he\u2019d died with his fellows at Fort Defiance now! Eldolith ended up taking her remaining men to work for the Felkan Kingdom, one of the last mercenary squads to stay in Rask.\n\nUlivik said his goodbyes to his family and you even before the mercenary work dried up. Said he was bored of it and wanted to see more of the world and become an \u201cadventurer.\u201d You think his parents were even less pleased to hear that than when he wanted to be a merc, and you\u2019ve never quite understood the appeal of the wandering life of an adventurer either, but you wished him the best. When he left, he thanked you one more time for taking the time to teach him when nobody else would.\n\nYou were always glad he got over his resentment of you due to your harsh training. And while it is true you did initially train him for coin and swore an oath to his parents to look after him during that time, it is because of those actions that you discovered a little more about yourself and focused yourself in the direction to open up your combat school.\n\nOf course your actions have now changed Rask to an extent that you may have very well put yourself out of a job, but you aren\u2019t worried. You still get students from Keplavisk, so you\u2019ll probably always have a bit of business. Even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve been doing some saving over the years.\n\nYou can only prepare yourself now, for whatever changes might come in the future.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 65\n\nYou get a knock on the door to which causes you to wonder who would be bothering you at this time of night. You\u2019re more than a little annoyed since you were sleeping.\n\n\u201cGo away, I ain\u2019t getting up.\u201d you say from your chair trying to go back to sleep.\n\u201cOpen the fuck up, you useless old man!\u201d you hear from outside and it\u2019s enough to motivate you to answer it and punch out the fool who said it. When you open it however, an unexpected visitor meets you.\n\n\u201cUlivik?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me! Well, aren\u2019t you going to invite me in?\u201d he laughs.\n\u201cYeah sure.\u201d You say and the both of you head to your quarters to sit and talk. You still shaking the cobwebs after being awaken from your slumber.\n\n\u201cWere you asleep?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what of it?\u201d\n\u201cNothing! Just sort of surprised, I mean I know it\u2019s night, but its still pretty early.\u201d\n\u201cEh, it\u2019s been kind of a lazy day today, felt like sleeping for most of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t teach a class today?\u201d\n\u201cClass? School\u2019s been officially closed for about two years now. I mean I get few people that seek me out looking to increase their skills every once in awhile, but nowadays everyone goes to that new military academy they opened up here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I was wondering what that big new building looming near the edge of town was, so they didn\u2019t offer you a job there?\u201d\n\u201cEh, they did, but I didn\u2019t want it. People who I originally trained run it and most of them I didn\u2019t even like when I was teaching them, so I\u2019d rather not have to follow whatever silly guidelines they\u2019ve come up with for that place. Anyway, I sometimes get paid to give speeches on tactics and strategies there. I get by. So where have you been and what brings you back?\u201d\n\nUlivik mentions he mainly returned to when he heard his father had died and that he\u2019s probably going to be around for a while to look after his mother. He then excitedly goes on about his various adventures of exploring ruins, caves and finding treasures and lost trinkets. Not enough to get rich, but he\u2019s not in it for that. You enjoy hearing about it all, it\u2019s not like you really go anywhere or do as much anymore. And as the years go on, you are finding yourself with less and less to do. You sort of thought your school and teaching would occupy your time and that if you got bored of that you could always break it up with a little mercenary work. But both of those options are pretty much closed off to you at this point, at least in Rask. The place is less wild and more peaceful now than it ever was under the Empire.\n\nYou could move you suppose, but it\u2019s not such a bad life maybe you should just settle in and enjoy your elderly years in relative peace\u2026\n\n\u201c..and so then I got my head split open and my entrails eaten by the clawbeast and died. Hey! Are you still with me?\u201d Ulivik asks.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah you got your entrails eaten and died.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell glad to see you\u2019re still listening.\u201d Ulivik laughs.\n\u201cSorry, just a little preoccupied. Anyway, go on.\u201d\n\nUlivik knows something\u2019s up with you, and he\u2019s got a pretty good idea what it is.\n\n\u201cHey, have you ever thought about leaving Rask and joining your old buddies in the Eternal Dominion?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWha\u2026oh I don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me. Besides I only have two there, dunno if one of them is even still alive and I never really was exactly friends with Edgar. Speaking of which did you have much trouble traveling through the ED? I heard they aren\u2019t too fond of svelk there ever since most of your people have been hiring themselves out to the Felkans.\u201d\nWell as you once pointed out, we\u2019re not really liked anywhere we go, but I never really kept to the populated areas while in the ED so I didn\u2019t have too many problems. However, I did find that dropping your name helped me a few times. You\u2019re sort of known there.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. Dunno, why I would be, not like I was ever part of the place. Guess Edgar really did look up to me. Unexpected.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he offer you a job too one time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s still available though. Like I said, my time serving big governments is over with. I wasted more than thirty years of my life doing it. Not going to waste the remaining years I have left even if it\u2019s a high position of power. Besides, I\u2019m still not sure that I wouldn\u2019t have to kill Edgar if I ever got into an argument with him over something.\u201d\n\u201cSurely it would be more interesting than sleeping all day.\u201d\n\u201cHah, probably. I dunno, I just feel like Edgar\u2019s Eternal Dominion is just mimicking a lot of the old Empire. Sure it\u2019s doing well now, but ultimately it\u2019s going to fall just like the Empire did, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well you could offer your services to the Felkan Kingdom, I think they could use the help.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no. I\u2019m not into lost causes. Did that before too and saw the results. The Felkan Kingdom could\u2019ve won the war if they didn\u2019t fight so defensively. There were many times early in the war where they should\u2019ve pressed an attack and took territory. Their fate is probably sealed at this point. Only a matter of time, assuming the ED keeps with it\u2019s policy of total conquest, and doesn\u2019t fuck it up. Anyway don\u2019t get me started on how I nearly got dragged into serving on both sides of that conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but how about another proposal?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bite. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, as you know I\u2019m going to be here awhile looking after my mother, but I need something to do. Rask still has areas of it that are largely unexplored. I sort wondered if you\u2019d like to come with me on an adventure in this very area.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And where would this place be? Most of the places you\u2019re speaking of involve mountains, and as bored as I am, I\u2019m not about to go dragging my ass up a fucking mountain.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, nah not the mountains, though it still might involve a little bit of climbing.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so where?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wendigo Hills.\u201d\n\nNow there\u2019s name that\u2019s spoken of in only whispers nowadays in Rask. Everyone knows about it and doesn\u2019t speak about it, let alone go near it, from humans to ogres and even the few giants still left. Ever since you wiped them out forty five years ago, there have been little problems from those evil spirits. Years later after you first left Rask you heard the various villages got their holy men together to perform some sort of ritual to make sure none of the spirits managed to ever escape from those cursed hills ever again. Of course every once in a blue moon some unfortunate idiot\u2026usually an adventurer gets himself possessed and no expense is spared in hunting down the creature and destroying it.\n\nNow it looks like Ulivik is intent on being that new unfortunate idiot.\n\n\u201cHave you lost your fucking mind, because if you haven\u2019t, then you will if you go there and that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky. I went to that blasted place once, I had a company of soldiers with me and I was in my prime. I barely got out of that place alive and you know what happened to the few soldiers that survived with me? Four of them ultimately committed suicide from their nightmares and the other two got discharged and thrown in the asylum for just going batshit insane. No, I\u2019m not going and if you got any sense, you won\u2019t either. That place does shit your mind. The spirits there are pure evil, and they are not to be trifled with.\u201d\n\"No, I have a remedy for that! Look at these!\" Ulivik says and produces two amulets with a faint blue glow.\n\n\"Let me guess, these things are magical and they're supposed to protect us from getting possessed.\"\n\"Correct! Even when I was little, I heard there was supposed to be great treasure in those hills. Nobody has ever had the skill to go in there and claim it, but I want to be the first because I truly feel like I'm ready now. You're the about the one who has traveled the most in those hills and survived. You would be a great help and we can even share whatever we find! Come on, it'll be like old times!\"\n\n\"Old\" being the key word here. While you were wondering if you were becoming more complacent in your old age, you aren't sure if going to the Wendigo Hills is something you want to do just to prove \"you still got it.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Help Ulivik", "result": "Ulivik may be an accomplished warrior now, but out of all the tales he\u2019s told you about his adventures; he still hasn\u2019t faced anything like the wendigos and he\u2019s going to get himself killed or worse if he goes into this with just the hope of some magic bauble around his neck. As much as you\u2019re loathed to go through this again, you decide to help Ulivik.\n\n\u201cAlright I\u2019ll go, but as soon as I think we\u2019re in a shitload of danger that we can\u2019t handle, you better listen to me, because this isn\u2019t going to be the fun adventure you think it\u2019s going to be. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cSure, but I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as bad as all that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019ll probably be worse. Now if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019m going to get some sleep and get my mind focused on this fool\u2019s task.\u201d\n\u201cFool\u2019s task? You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, which says more about my own foolishness than yours, because you don\u2019t know any better. I know we got these magic amulets or whatever, but these\u2026 things are going to try to get inside your head and if they succeed, it\u2019s all over. If that happens to you, I won\u2019t hesitate to put a sword through your head, and I expect you to do the same.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha you\u2019d kill me so easily?\u201d Ulivik laughs, but you\u2019re in no mood.\n\u201cHello, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met\u2026by the gods have you remembered nothing of the stories of my past? Of course I\u2019d fucking do it so easily! I\u2019ve killed innocent men and their entire families just because they disagreed with how the Empire was doing things, hell I even killed one of my Eternal brothers because of it. Wouldn\u2019t be anything to kill someone who was turned into a mindless beast even if\u2026\u201d\n\nYou stop yourself right there.\n\n\u201cEven if what?\u201d Ulivik asks.\n\u201cEven if\u2026he\u2019s too stupid to see this is a really bad idea! Anyway, I\u2019m ranting and I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going to bed, you can let yourself out. And don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have to go, because I\u2019m already committed now. I gave you my word as an Eternal.\u201d\n\nUlivik knows when you say something like that, you\u2019re being serious, so he just nods and tells you he\u2019ll be by tomorrow morning before leaving. As for you, you head off to bed with a myriad of thoughts going on in your head.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I nearly said he was like a son to me. What the fuck am I thinkin\u2019 about? Better get your head in the game old man, because wendigos are going to thrive on that. They live on weakness.\u201d You mumble before drifting off to sleep.\n\nThe next morning you and Ulivik set off for the infamous Wendigo Hills. Along the way, you go on about your own major conflicts with them, even when they were originally just thought to be people infected with lycanthropy like the rest of the old barbarian tribes around Rask. Ulivik listens to you in fascination like he did when he was much younger as you\u2019ve never spoken of your experience with the wendigos before to him except in passing. It\u2019s good to know he\u2019s still listening.\n\n\u201cSo after that battle, no wendigo has ever left those hills?\u201d Ulivik asks.\n\u201cEh, we had a couple that still managed to snag bodies and kill a few people before being brought down and exorcised by some of the local hedge wizards we recruited later, but that was mainly due to people idiotically still going into the hills in the first place. Sort of like what we\u2019re doing.\u201d You say.\n\u201cBut if they\u2019re spirits can\u2019t they just float about possessing people?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d think so, but for whatever reason they can\u2019t leave these the hills in pure spirit form, they need a body. That\u2019s why when they\u2019re killed they immediately try to hop into a new one or else they get pulled back to the hills. Dunno why, and I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s bothered to learn the history either. Everyone\u2019s just glad they were deprived of nearly all of their bodies by a certain Eternal decades ago.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, but what about animals? Couldn\u2019t they just possess animals and leave the hills that way?\u201d\n\u201cAlways wondered that myself, but again if they could I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d still be a major threat. Besides, when I traversed those hills I didn\u2019t see a single animal, not one, of course I assumed that they probably ate them all. The wendigo are basically consumption and hunger in its purest form. They aren\u2019t big thinkers in the scheme of things and it\u2019s fortunate that they never organized past their barbarian tribal hosts.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like it, but if they are all spirits as you say, then we shouldn\u2019t experience any physical combat at all and with these amulets and our steel trap minds we should be fine! We might even find some sort of ancient lore about how the wendigos came to be tied to those hills!\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re as optimistic as ever. I suppose that\u2019s good, it\u2019ll keep your mind better prepared when the wendigos try to oppressively crush your free will. Y\u2019know, now that I think about it, I think that\u2019s what partially saved me. My mind was so dedicated to the Empire back in those days, the wendigos were trying to crush something that wasn\u2019t really my own to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cNow? I got my impenetrable cynicism to protect me, which I\u2019ll definitely put more stock in than this ridiculous magical amulet that\u2019ll undoubtedly fail to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re off to a good start with your cynicism.\u201d\n\nThe after a couple days of travel, you eventually make it to the base of the Wendigo Hills. The markings and warning signs line stretch up, down and all the way around as far as you know. No real physical barriers of course, but even those dumb ass ogres that can\u2019t read know better than to pass the line. Of course they usually knew better to begin with, which proves that they\u2019re smarter in that respect. You take a deep breath and step past the markings and make your way up the forested hills.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point your amulet starts to glow a brighter blue, Ulivik claims \u201cthat\u2019s how you know that it\u2019s working!\u201d Great. Still, you don\u2019t hear any sinister whispers yet, but there is still that dead silence you remember. As if nothing living is here.\n\nUlivik, mentions that he found a crude and well worn map of some of the Rask area during his trip through Eternal Dominion lands and wants to explore some ruins that are clearly marked on it. You mention you haven\u2019t been here in a long time, but you don\u2019t remember ever seeing any, so you can\u2019t be as of much help as he might\u2019ve thought. Ulivik says he doesn\u2019t care though, he\u2019s just glad to have you along.\n\n\u201cThat map is probably old Empire. Like really old Empire, and much might\u2019ve changed since then. It could also be inaccurate to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true, but we might as well find out. It\u2019s the journey, not necessarily the destination that\u2019s important! That\u2019s what adventuring is all about.\u201d\n\u201cFunny, I always thought it was the misguided hope of finding lots of loot and the avoidance of a real job.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a bonus.\u201d Ulivik comments and you allow yourself to chuckle. Never thought you\u2019d do that while in this cursed place.\n\nAfter a half hour or so of walking, you start to get an uneasy feeling of being watched. You mention this to Ulivik and he says he\u2019s getting that impression too. You ask him if he\u2019s hearing anything, but he says he isn\u2019t except the snow crunching under foot. Neither are you, maybe the amulets are working, but it\u2019s obvious the presence of the wendigos is near.\n\nAnother hour of travel and you and Ulivik see something you didn\u2019t expect.\n\n\u201cDo you see that? That\u2019s a rabbit! I thought you said nothing was living here?\u201d Ulivik says.\n\u201cWhen I came through I didn\u2019t see a living creature, so I just assumed there wasn\u2019t. I guess there is though.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cMaybe the wendigo aren\u2019t here anymore and everyone has been scared of this place for decades for no reason.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far. Something is definitely here and just because we\u2019re seeing rabbits doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe. It just means animals must not be suitable hosts for them.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026hey that rabbit it\u2019s hopping towards us. Hmm, a little larger than average and hopping towards people is rather unusual behavior for a ra\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore Ulivik can finish, his leg is leaped upon and viciously attacked by the rabbit. After some hollering from the surprise, you grab the little furry beast and break its neck. You toss its lifeless body in the snow while Ulivik examines the bite marks in his pants\n\n\u201cFuck, that thing chewed through my pant leg and broke the skin! You never mentioned killer rabbits on your travel to here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t encounter any, and I doubt if that was really a rabbit anymore. It would seem that animals CAN be hosts after all, they just need a human one or something similar to leave the hills. Anyway, we should really get out here, there are more coming.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? So? I\u2019m sure we can handle a few overgrown possessed rabbits.\u201d Ulivik says still preoccupied with his very minor wound.\n\u201cA few, sure, but how about hundreds of them?\u201d you say and draw his attention to literally that number popping up all around you.\n\nThe glaring red eyes of hundreds of possessed bunnies are upon you and their herbivore buck teeth have now been replaced with the toothy fangs of a carnivore hungry for flesh. And they look like they haven\u2019t tasted a bi-ped in a long time\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Fight your way back home", "result": "You slash out at the nearest rabbits and shout at Ulivik that you need to get the hell out of here.\n\n\u201cWhat?! We can\u2019t run from rabbits! We\u2019ve both fought worse than this!\u201d Ulivik shouts chopping down a few more of them.\n\u201cFirst of all they aren\u2019t just rabbits, they\u2019re rabbits with wendigos in them. Second of all rabbits are notorious for breeding at an alarming rate. Chances are there are even more bunny bodies for the wendigos to take control of even if we manage to kill all of the ones here. Running from rabbits might not exactly be the bravest thing, but constantly being assaulted by a horde while going deeper into enemy territory and trying to find something that might not even be there anymore is just stupid.\u201d You say hacking at more of them and shaking off the ones jumping on you.\n\u201c\u2026agh! Oh all right!\u201d Ulivik shouts and the pair of you manage to cut a path through the rabbit mass and make a break for it.\u201d\n\nYou and Ulivik run chopping up rabbits along the way as the \u201clittle\u201d nippers are hopping after you and occasionally leaping on you and get a few bites in. This might all be very comical if your life wasn\u2019t in mortal danger.\n\n\u201cSHIT!\u201d Ulivik shouts when a group of rabbits catch up and pile on one of his ankles, biting and clawing at it. He falls down face first into the snow and you immediately get rid of the rabbits around Ulivik who is doing likewise.\n\n\u201cGet off! Get off!\u201d he shouts killing them.\n\nWhile you\u2019re kneeling down trying to help, one of the rabbits jumps on your back and with his teeth takes the amulet chain and leaps off with it.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026get that little furry bastard!\u201d you shout when you feel it lifted from around your neck, but it\u2019s too late the rabbit has run off with it and the rest of the horde is coming.\n\n\u201cCome on we gotta get outta here!\u201d Ulivik says and the pair of you resume your escape. Unfortunately you\u2019re starting to hear the whispers again. The multitude of them, though one in particular stands out.\n\n\u201cWelcome back Bane of Rask, we\u2019ve been waiting for you\u2026I\u2019VE been waiting for you.\u201d A voice in your head says.\n\u201cShit, it\u2019s starting, they\u2019re getting inside my head!\u201d you say stomping on another rabbit.\n\u201cJust ignore it like you did last time!\u201d Ulivik exclaims.\n\u201cEasy for you to say! Argh dammit! My fucking head!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten old Bane\u2026you should just give up and let me take over, you\u2019ll be able to lifetimes\u2026\u201d the voice says.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you resist, you\u2019re too weak now. Just submit and this will all go easier\u2026\u201d\n\nBetween the spiritual assaults on your mind and Ulivik\u2019s chewed up ankle the pair of you aren\u2019t exactly running the fastest anymore. You have to stop many times to fight your way through, but it may be true that luck favors the fool and the pair of you have been mighty foolish for doing this in the first place, and eventually you see the end in sight.\n\n\u201cThere! The markers! If we get past those we\u2019ll be fine!\u201d\n\nUlivik speaks too soon however as it is at this point several hundred white rabbits who were blending in with the snow open their eyes and reveal the glowing red pin points of evil within them. They sit between you and the closest escape and a larger gray rabbit comes bounding out of a nearby hole in the ground. It\u2019s nearly the size of a bear. You fought a gray wendigo before; you would guess this is the same one. Their leader and the main one that\u2019s been taunting you the whole time.\n\n\u201cGive up Bane! Your time on this earth is over!\u201d\n\u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP!\u201d\n\u201cBecome meat then! I\u2019ll just use your svelk friend since you seem to care for him so much!\u201d\n\nYou hadn\u2019t heard it yet even with the assault on your head, but all of the rabbits in unison make that awful howling noise that you tried so hard to forget about. Even Ulivik with his magical protection winces at the noise. The battle is then joined as they run at you. You feel bites and slashes of several little claws and teeth breaking your skin. In a way the physical pain helps since its counter acting the mental attack still going on in your head.\n\nThe wendigo leader clumsily leaps towards you even stepping on his own smaller brethren. You roll away and give him a couple chops to his head, succeeding in lopping off part of his ear. This only serves to anger him further and he does a short rush into you, knocking you down. Other rabbits immediately take advantage of the situation and hop on top you and start to bite. You\u2019re busily trying to get them off of you and then the leader smacks you in the head with his oversized claws. You fall into the snow again, this time in a daze.\n\n\u201cYou call yourself an Eternal\u2026such arrogance of an incredibly short lived race. WE have more right to be known as eternals and I will make you suffer for your hubris!\u201d you hear the voice say and then several long fangs sink into the lower part of your leg as the leader attempts to eat you alive. Now you aren\u2019t exactly sure at this point due to the extreme physical pain, but you believe the wendigo leader has most likely bitten straight through your leg and if it hasn\u2019t been completely severed yet, it\u2019s only hanging on by broken bone and torn skin.\n\nYou yell out and muster all your remaining strength, sit up and bring your sword down onto the wendigo leader\u2019s head. Blood spurts everywhere as you twist it into his skull and your own leg is still chewed on in the death throes of the wendigo\u2019s host. Ulivik, who was being overwhelmed by the rest of the rabbits, finally manages to get to you and runs his own sword into the side of the gray wendigo several times causing it to finally release its fangs from your mangled leg. You quickly remove it from the wendigo\u2019s mouth and see a good portion of your leg completely destroyed and bleeding profusely. Despite this fact, you\u2019re determined that you are NOT going to die today. You didn\u2019t get this far just to be eaten by some possessed fucking rabbits. Ulivik helps you up and you hop as fast as you can towards the markers leaving a trail of gore in your wake. When you fall, you crawl as fast as you can instead. Ulivik tries to carry you, but you tell him to just keep the rest of the rabbits off of the pair of you.\n\nExhausted and severely injured you manage to make it past the safety barrier, causing the attack to completely cease and you no longer hear the whispers in your head any longer. The rabbits all stare at you from afar. You\u2019re only about ten feet away and you can feel their hatred all the way from here. Ulivik drags you further away from the wendigo area until you tell him to stop.\n\n\u201cHey! Stop it, I\u2019m not a fucking rag doll!\u201d you shout. \u201cI need to do something about this leg and fast, I\u2019m beginning to feel really dizzy over here. Make a fire and quickly!\u201d\n\nOne quick look and you know there\u2019s no way it can be saved. It\u2019s only hanging on as it is. You make the decision and chop through the remaining bone and muscle that was still connecting it to the rest of your body. This part doesn\u2019t hurt as it\u2019s mostly already disconnected from any nerves anyway. The following part of applying your heated sword to stop the bleeding hurts like hell though.\n\nDizzy and weakened from this whole ordeal, you see that you\u2019ve stopped the bleeding and fall unconscious mumbling \u201cDon\u2019t leave my leg here.\u201d\n\nA couple days later you finally wake up, though you almost weren\u2019t expecting to.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re up, good. Your new leg is finished; I had the wood carver make one for you after I dragged your body back to town. The people here were shocked to see you laid out in such a manner. They thought you were dead at first.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I sort of wish I was\u2026I\u2019m hardly the supreme warrior I once was, if I\u2019m getting my leg chewed off by oversized rabbits. I\u2019m just not quite ashamed enough to kill myself over it, my will to survive is just too strong I guess.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault anyway, I should\u2019ve went into that area myself\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh no. Don\u2019t start doing that. Blaming yourself for what MIGHT have happened is a losing battle. Trust me, I\u2019ve had that same battle. I\u2019m an adult I make my own decisions and I chose to go with you, besides if I hadn\u2019t have come you would\u2019ve had all those little killer wendigo bunnies all over your ass instead and knowing you, you would\u2019ve still insisted on heading to those ruins and gotten yourself killed in the process.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, maybe so.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) fucking rabbits...you know they must\u2019ve been cannibalizing themselves in those forms for years. Well the wendigos might not have killed me, but I\u2019m sure my reputation is. Ah fuck it, if I get a few snickers from the locals for losing my leg to a damned rabbit, it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, about that\u2026I sort of lied. I told everyone you saved my life from a ten-foot wendigo that had taken host in an ogre turning it into a complete abomination with rows of teeth and that it was planning to organize a way for the rest of its fellows to leave the barrier.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t like to lie, but I just thought it sounded a lot more impressive. I mean you know the situation was really dangerous and I know the situation was really dangerous, but everyone else would just think\u2026rabbits? And then laugh like you said.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not actually opposed to lying, I just don\u2019t do it when I respect the person enough not to do it to them. Anyway, I guess you were just concerned about my reputation. I won\u2019t argue the point and it\u2019s done now, besides it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to confirm it by going up there. Hopefully I just don\u2019t get anymore snot nosed kids following me around town begging me to train them because those days are long over.\u201d You laugh.\n\nYou and Ulivik both talk for a few more hours before he eventually leaves to go see his mother. You take the opportunity to inspect your new wooden leg and try it on. It\u2019s going to take some time getting used to, but most major changes do and you\u2019ve survived those.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 75\n\nAs the years creep up on you and despite missing part of your leg, you still feel don\u2019t feel in any ill health. It\u2019s mostly just aches and pains from your more physical years catching up with you. After the leg incident though, you took that permanent position at the Keplavisk military academy as a strategy instructor, though nowadays it\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll become the Rask military academy. Rask is in the process of becoming a \u201creal nation\u201d rather than just a collection of allied towns. You don\u2019t really know all the politics of it, but the main guiding force was justified Raskian paranoia again. Ever since the Eternal Dominion\u2019s war with the Felkan Kingdom grinded to a halt, the ED has been making overtures to Rask to join them in the veiled form of threats rather than any sort of diplomatic alliance agreements.\n\nWhile starting a war on two fronts is always a bad idea you\u2019re guessing Edgar needs the resources that Rask has to make his final push to conquer the Felkans once and for all. You\u2019re also guessing he\u2019s intent on ignoring your advice of not attacking Rask too, you\u2019re just surprised he held out this long. You\u2019re not really worried about it if it comes to war. The Raskians may not have the unnaturally bred \u201ceternals\u201d like the ED does, but they\u2019re trained well enough to make the cost very high if they are in invaded. You should know, you trained most of them.\n\nYou hear a knock on your door and you slowly make your way over.\n\n\u201cMail for you Mr. Bane.\u201d A delivery girl says to you when you open up the door. You toss a gold coin to her and take your letter.\n\nAt first you figure it\u2019s from Ulivik, no doubt telling you about whatever grand adventure he\u2019s on this time. The last time he was here, he was for his mother\u2019s funeral. He kept his composure for the most part, but it still wasn\u2019t a good time for him. He didn\u2019t say it in so many words, but he did say that you were the only family he had left. You didn\u2019t follow up, but the pair you said your goodbyes both of you knowing that you had that bond similar to that of a father and son.\n\nBut this letter isn\u2019t from Ulivik, it\u2019s mysteriously labeled as from \u201ca friend.\u201d Considering you\u2019ve never really had any, you\u2019re baffled to as who it could be. When you open it you see that it\u2019s from Edgar, several pages in fact. You sit down to read all of it.\n\nThe beginning of it hopes that the letter has found you as he wants you to take in all of what he has to tell you. He begins by stating that he\u2019s dying. He mentions his health is deteriorating by the day and he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he has left. His \u201csuccessors\u201d are likely to start a war with Rask soon after his death, it\u2019s only due to their respect that they don\u2019t. The same way his respect for you caused him not to.\n\nThe majority of the letter explains that he wants you to understand why he did what he did and how he wished that you had joined him. He says the incident with Kane never left him and how if he\u2019d only been there to listen to him and help him more, none of that might\u2019ve happened. Perhaps even the Empire would\u2019ve survived. (You doubt that though, it would\u2019ve just taken longer) When the Empire was in its last days he saw how chaotic the new eternals were and realized they needed guidance and a purpose much like Kane did. He always thought that you\u2019d do it, but you left leaving him as the only person willing to. He says it was very difficult and while they ultimately they fell in line, but without the purpose of conquest they wouldn\u2019t stay that way for long. So he began forging a new empire as it were, with the eternals as the leaders as it always should\u2019ve been. The newer generations of eternals were better disciplined, as he made sure their training went very much the same way yours did. Still, they are much more arrogant that he ever was. They believe it is their destiny to rule the world and he believes that he\u2019s set something in motion that even he is no longer in control of.\n\n\u201cAh Edgar, always getting yourself in over your head.\u201d You say to yourself.\n\nThe rest of the letter mentions that you two are the last of the old Eternals. Warrick died in Battle of Yaquan when the ED successfully took the city from the Felkans eleven years ago. He says that while he still considered him a traitor to side with former enemies like that, he took no pleasure in his death and heard he died well.\n\nBrenda died four years ago, but she apparently had become increasingly withdrawn years before that, to the point where she no longer even participated in the major decisions concerning the ED. She was found dead by her own hand with a note stating that she wished to be burned and her ashes scattered near Fort Glory like she did with her husband Roldan. This wish was of course granted.\n\nEdgar\u2019s last portion of the message also states that he has a last request as well, he wants you to come to the Eternal Dominion as he would like to see you again. He knows that you\u2019ve had your differences and you weren\u2019t ever friends, but right now, you\u2019re the closest thing he\u2019s got. He\u2019s already made the arrangements to let you through and will have an escort waiting for you on the Rask/ED borders for the next few days. He also has placed a separate message with his seal on it, so that they may identify you.\n\nThe message ends there.", "action_results": [{"action": "Take a trip to the Eternal Dominion", "result": "If Edgar wants to see you, then why not? If he had anything sinister planned for you like having his escort kill you when you arrive. Besides you\u2019re old and you didn\u2019t worry about dying in combat when you were twenty, you\u2019re not going to start worrying about it now.\n\nYou pack a few things for your trip and get your horse ready since you know Rask carriages don\u2019t travel through ED territory anymore. It\u2019s hard getting on damn a horse ever since losing part of your leg, but you\u2019re not about to walk the way there!\n\nWhen you reach the border the next day, you see a group of soldiers camped out in the distance beyond it. You see an ED Flag flying so you assume that\u2019s the escort Edgar told you about. When you approach several of the soldiers point muskets at you\u2026heh you sometimes forget of how technology has marched on.\n\nThey immediately ask for identification and you state your name and hand them the message with Edgar\u2019s seal on it. The leader, who is a blonde woman with fair features reads through it and greets you.\n\n\u201cGreetings sir. My apologies on the initial caution, but we had to be sure. I am Sergeant Kalah, and I am to escort you to Prime Eternal Edgar. I am told he will be most pleased to see you, though I must admit I was also curious about you myself. Many are, as the Prime Eternal has mentioned you several times in high regard.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, yeah I\u2019ve heard about that before. Never get used to it though. Well let\u2019s get on our way then.\u201d\n\nSergeant Kalah is very talkative on your trip, and goes on about great the ED is, and how it provides for all. She sounds very much like you did a long time ago. You\u2019re a little curious about something so you interrupt her propaganda speak.\n\n\u201cTell me sergeant, you and your men are all on the youngish side, what generation of eternal are you exactly?\u201d\n\u201cMe sir? I am fourth! We all are, we are newest eternals to serve directly in combat and I\u2019m proud to say that we are so far the first to have natural night vision!\u201d\n\u201cYou can see in the dark eh? That must come in pretty handy. Wish I\u2019d had that back in the day.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, the glorious Eternal Dominion was able to fight those treacherous svelk mercenaries that the cowardly Felkans employ on equal footing when we were deployed!\u201d\n\u201cHmm, any other natural abilities?\u201d\n\u201cThe fourth generation also regenerates better than the third even though they were the first to have such abilities. Under the right circumstances we can potentially regenerate a lost limb.\u201d\n\u201cNow THAT is something I definitely would\u2019ve liked to had!\u201d you say knocking on your wooden leg. \u201cStill, with all these advantages I\u2019m sort of surprised you haven\u2019t utterly crushed the Felkans yet.\u201d\n\u201cI believe we would, even with our resource shortages. Most of us do! We have the Felkans on the run, I do not understand why we have not pressed forward with our attacks, I long to be in combat again\u2026but it is not my place to question the Prime Eternal\u2019s decisions, I\u2019m sure he has a good reason\u2026\u201d\n\nWow, that line sounds familiar.\n\n\u201cWell all I can say is, sometimes the political aspects of a nation are more complicated than the wars.\u201d You reply\n\nSergeant Kalah doesn\u2019t argue, but just says that you may have more wisdom about such things. Kalah and you continue to speak with each other about various subjects and she\u2019s courteous the entire time, in fact she\u2019s downright friendly. You definitely weren\u2019t expecting that and it\u2019s sort of a nice change of pace. While traveling through a town, a couple of pathetic peasants are being beaten in the streets by another soldier, though his uniform seems to be a different color even though it has the same markings.\n\n\u201cYou there! Why are you beating these peasants! What crime have they committed?\u201d she demands.\n\u201cMa\u2019am! These peasants were caught stealing food.\u201d\n\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t be beating them just for that\u2026you should be chopping their hands off!\u201d Kalah says, followed by pleas and screams of the peasants.\n\u201c\u2026yes ma\u2019am\u2026alright get over here you lousy thieving scum, let\u2019s make this quick!\u201d the soldier says drawing his sword and striking out at the screaming peasant. However, in his enthusiasm to follow orders he ends up hacking off the peasant\u2019s entire arm.\n\nMore screaming arises from the female peasant who rushes to what is probably are dying husband. Sergeant Kalah rolls her eyes.\n\n\u201cI swear never let a human do an Eternal\u2019s job\u2026men shoot all three of them.\u201d\n\u201cNo wait!\u201d the soldier says before several musket balls hit his body. The two peasants are also killed instantly.\n\nThe onlookers of this event duck and hide, but the sergeant makes her point known.\n\n\u201cListen up! This town is now on watch! If I hear of anymore thievery or other crimes, I\u2019ll be back to burn down this whole town! And for those of you in charge of keeping the law around here, I better see more competence displayed in the future than I saw today or I\u2019ll have you drawn and quartered! You are ALL servants of the Eternals! We are your masters, we know better than you and you will OBEY.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is, the ruthless arrogance. It would appear than Kalah\u2019s friendliness extends only to other Eternals. Can\u2019t say you\u2019re surprised though. You all move on and eventually you reach the capital and the palace where Edgar resides. Funny how this is the first time you\u2019ve ever been to the palace after all those years serving the Empire.\n\n\u201cThis is where we part company, but I must say I hope we meet again in the future, it was an honor to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it was a pleasure to meet you too\u2026\u201d you say and then you decide to give her a big fat thrill. \u201c\u2026and if I may say if we have more eternals as pretty and commanding as you, we will no doubt rule for thousands of years to come.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2026oh\u2026well thank you sir!\u201d she stutters and smiles before riding off.\n\nNew guards accompany you into the palace and through it. You\u2019ve never been in here before, so you do a little sight seeing as you walk. Eventually you reach the royal bedroom. An older woman is sitting on a chair outside sobbing. She looks regal. Did Edgar get married? You\u2019ve never heard of their being any sort of \u201cqueen\u201d of the ED you always assumed he was just ruling alone. Another older muscular man with a stern expression is standing nearby pacing. When you arrive, he frowns even more.\n\n\u201cOh so you decided to come after all. A pity.\u201d He says.\n\u201cWell, I certainly can say your military is politer than the royalty around here.\u201d\n\u201cThat is probably because they believe all the stories Prime Eternal Edgar says about you. Such is the foolishness of youth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who the hell are you exactly?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, not surprised a deserter like you doesn\u2019t remember me. My name is Rissok and I served under you during the Empire riots. I saw you kill my friend in cold blood. A true eternal who served with honor!\u201d\n\n\u201cOooooh now I remember. You and your other buddy were looting houses while Felding was attempting to rape a woman. Yeah, real honor there.\u201d You say and Rissok gets in your face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mock me! You are only here because the Prime allows it! If it were up to me, I would have you labeled as a traitor and have you killed!\u201d\n\u201cWell nothing is stopping you. You got the guards here, Edgar\u2019s too sick to prevent it and I\u2019ve only got one leg, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair fight.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cStop it! Stop it please! My Edgar is dying! Can\u2019t we have one moment without murder and killing?\u201d the woman sobs.\n\nAt this point Rissok storms off without another word, the guards stick around and tell you that you may enter at any time. Before you do, you have to ask the woman who she is because you get the impression she isn\u2019t an eternal. You just sense it.\n\n\u201cMy apologies, I didn\u2019t know that Edgar was even married. What title do you go by, queen? Emperess?\u201d\n\u201c(sniff) No, I\u2019m none of those things. I\u2019m just Eva. Sometime Lady Eva if we\u2019re being formal, but I am not married to Edgar nor am I common knowledge to a majority of the public, I am merely his companion of sorts. He could not marry me, for concern of marrying a non-eternal might weaken his position of leadership. I understood this from the beginning though and do not blame him for it. Eternals have more wisdom on these matters.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re pretty sure that isn\u2019t necessarily true, but you understand Edgar\u2019s rationale and Eva seems to genuinely be in love with him. You ask her if she wants to come in with you, but she says she has already said her goodbyes and that he wants to see you alone when you arrive. Having no other questions, you enter the bedroom.\n\nWhen you see Edgar, he\u2019s lying in his bed and looking completely unwell. He\u2019s pale and his face has a gaunt looking appearance. You can\u2019t even believe this is the same man you fought along side at Fort Defiance.\n\n\u201cEdgar? \u201d\n\u201c(wheeze) ah\u2026you came\u2026I knew you would. (cough cough) You\u2019re also looking much better than I am\u2026minus a leg I see. How did that happen?\u201d\n\u201cLong story\u2026but you! How the hell did you get this sick?! Other than physical pains racking my body, I\u2019ve never been actually sick. I didn\u2019t think we could!\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026after you\u2019ve suffered five or six assassination attempts all laced with various poisons, it tends to fuck up your body a lot quicker\u2026anyway there isn\u2019t much time left I doubt if I\u2019ll make it through the night (cough cough) you\u2019ve read my letter I take it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you know that when my death comes, anarchy will ensue.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a successor? What about Eva?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but we can\u2019t have children. We Eternals seem to be sterile or barren. I\u2019ve had people try to look into this problem, but they haven\u2019t come up with anything yet. It would seem what makes us superior, takes away our ability to reproduce. Maybe it\u2019s nature balancing itself out, so that we don\u2019t take over the world like so many of our younger eternals seem to want to do.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I have to admit, I always wondered why all those strumpets I slept with during my merc days never came back with little bundles demanding support.\u201d You reply. \u201cAnyway (cough cough) I\u2019ve drawn up official forms for the person I think could be a successor\u2026\u201d\n\nYou already know where Edgar is going with this.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026don\u2019t say that\u2019s why you dragged me out here\u2026Edgar they aren\u2019t going to listen to me!

(wheeze cough) They\u2019ll listen more likely than you believe, why do you think I always spoke so highly of you? The younger ones will most likely follow without question, your major opposition will probably be the second generation\u2026but there aren\u2019t too many of them left, you could easily purge them all if you had to.\u201d\n\nSheesh, you haven\u2019t even agreed to anything and Edgar\u2019s already suggesting mass purges. It\u2019s like you never left the Empire.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026I tried to build something here\u2026(cough) I tried to do what you might\u2019ve done if only you\u2019d taken the reins of power, but I can\u2019t go on any longer. The only person who can guide the Eternal Dominion into something worthier is you. I\u2019m asking you not just as former comrade in arms\u2026but as a (cough cough) a fellow Eternal\u2026\u201d\n\nEdgar\u2019s trying to guilt you into this mess, but it\u2019s just not going to work. This plan of his is doomed to fail and you know it.

First of all it\u2019s not realistic despite what you want to believe and I think deep down you know that. Second of all, if I wanted the reins of power as you say, I would\u2019ve taken them a long time ago. Did I ever think about it? Sure, but I came to the conclusion that it wouldn\u2019t lead to anywhere good\u2026and given your condition I\u2019d say I was half right.

A project that failed utterly for its leaders.\n\nYou think about some of the other Eternals in your class that didn\u2019t even make it past training, or the few like Cyrus that were transferred to the Shadow Guard. You also heard there was a group of eternals that came before you, though all of them died in training and never even made it into the field while the Empire was still \u201cperfecting\u201d their plan.\n\nYou wonder if all of you had made it and kept together as a separate unit, would it have made a difference? Who knows? You wonder if you\u2019ll even be remembered as the years go by. Not just years or decades, but centuries.

She\u2019s worried as well, though she\u2019s understandably more upset about it.\n\nYour next move is to go to the militia and make a report, you don\u2019t expect anything to be done, but you figure that the \u201crisk\u201d of a possible wendigo possession is more than enough to keep all the towns alert about it. You are nearly tempted to go looking for him in wendigo territory yourself, but you decide that it would only serve in getting you killed as well, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019d even be able to track him.\n\nWeeks pass into months and there is still no sign of Ulivik. No wendigo attacks either, so you can only assume that he wasn\u2019t possessed, just killed and eaten. Many times you go back and forth in your head wondering if you\u2019d just gone with him that maybe he\u2019d still be alive\u2026or maybe there would be two dead instead of one.

You give your opinion on the Eternal Dominion situation, but you leave out the whole meeting with Brenda and Warrick of course. Eventually the politicians agree that more protection might be necessary and steps to ensure it are taken. Since you brought all this to their attention, you are nominated to run the military academy.\n\nYear 58\n\nEdgar took your advice\u2026at least initially.

Edgar has adapted with the times unlike the Empire and has implementied stolen technology from the Felkans. You can only imagine how Warrick has fared, but you got your own problems due to your lying, though maybe it was inevitable, who can say?\n\nWhen it became apparent that you weren\u2019t actually doing anything to help bring Rask under the Eternal Dominion banner, Edgar correctly came to the conclusion that you lied. Sensing that Rask may even be gearing up for their own invasion, Edgar risks a two front war and strikes out at Rask.\n\nWhile the Eternal Dominion is certainly short of man power due to their war with the Felkan Kingdom, they make up for it with ruthless fanaticism and of course the fact that they\u2019re using updated technology as well. Their first major push is at Kenneth\u2019s Rest. The old fort stands strong for a day before it is taken. Everyone that wasn\u2019t killed during the battle or escaped was executed upon capture. This happens with a couple of the smaller villages before the Raskian army manages to stop the advance. From the butchery that the ED troops have been displaying it\u2019s obvious that they aren\u2019t taking prisoners.\n\nOn the Raskian side, patriotism goes up and they have no intention on surrendering if that was even indeed an option. Mercenaries, who were previously beginning to leave due to the lack of jobs for them suddenly become in the market again. They are used mainly for harassment purposes such as destroying supply lines. Flog has turned out to be quite the asset. He sees the Eternal Dominion to be nothing more than the Empire under a new name (And he really hated the Empire) and has managed to unite some of the more \u201ccivilized\u201d ogre tribes to help destroy the inheritors of the Empire legacy. Eldolith still runs her small svelk band and charges the highest price as usual for her services. Ulivik even has a small group of humans following him now. They mostly consist of survivors who managed to escape death at the hands of the ED attacks on their homes and in it for revenge not the money, in fact neither is Ulivik anymore. Ever since the invasion he gave up his mercenary life in exchange for that of a patriot fighting for his family and home. You\u2019re glad to see he has become a competent warrior.\n\nDue to your warning of this threat years before, your position at the academy and all your years of combat experience you are made into a full blown general and practically given extensive powers over all military functions. A very powerful position, in fact it\u2019s rather ironic. You didn\u2019t ask or even want to \u201crule\u201d over Rask, but your current arrangement practically makes you a potential dictator. Even more so due to the fact that you\u2019re an Eternal, a representation of a past oppressor and a current aggressor towards Rask.\n\nWhile the politicians have given you this role, not all Raskians are happy with this idea, but as long as you\u2019re fighting the Eternal Dominion no disgruntled Raskian has tried to assassinate you yet. While you miss being able to personally lead troops into battle, you still try to be as close to the action as you can, by traveling with the army rather than staying in an office somewhere.\n\nThe war with the ED has already taken quite a toll on Rask, and it doesn\u2019t look lik it\u2019s going to end anytime soon. The best you can do is dig in and make sure you make the ED pay for every inch they step deeper into Rask territory.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 65\n\nAs you settle down for the night, you think about how you got in this position.\n\nAs the war started to drag on, the tactics changed from one of conquest to one of annihilation. The ED began outright destroying any village and town they managed to capture. They sent in suicidal fanatics to blow themselves up or blow up mines and other areas of production. They managed to poison the water supply of one towns, but the worst was their intentional sacrifices in the Wendigo Hills. The ED dragged over a hundred of their own citizens into the Wendigo Hills, which had been off limits to any right thinking being ever since you went into that cursed territory. The wendigos had been confined there for decades with no sentient hosts to possess and allow their escape, but that all changed when presented with the new ones the ED provided. The wendigos of course immediately ran amok with their new bodies and became a problem for everyone.\n\nIn the meantime the ED attempted one last push on Keplavisk. It was a bloodbath on both sides and the cost was high, but ultimately it never fell, and it was that the last major battle with the ED. Hostilities with the Eternal Dominion aren\u2019t over, but they have stopped mostly due to their own internal problems. As powerful as they were, they couldn\u2019t keep up a two front war with two foes that had no intention on rolling over. It was only a matter of time before attrition took its toll on the ED and fortunately the arrogance of the younger eternals caused them to finally question Edgar\u2019s abilities to lead properly. Wasn\u2019t long before they started squabbling amongst themselves.\n\nOf course the damage they did to Rask left a permanent mark.\n\nYou were initially hailed as a hero by most and the rebuilding process begun, but Rask was in terrible condition. Towns and villages that hadn\u2019t been completely destroyed were still wrecked to a degree that would take months or even a year to recover. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, if they weren\u2019t also under protected due to a shortage of soldiers from the war. Wendigos, bandits, other monsters and even rogue eternals from the ED are such a problem that it makes the rebuilding process even longer and you conclude that spreading the soldiers too thin will ultimately hurt you in the long run.\n\nYou argue with the remaining politicians that what needs to be done is to cluster and re-group. Keplavisk is still the most intact and has always been the \u201ccapital\u201d of Rask of sorts and it\u2019s the biggest town to the point that\u2019s its practically a city. You say that the remaining Raskian population should move to Keplavisk where the focus can be directed into rebuilding it and protection can be easier.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a popular decision. Some Raskians don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just station more troops at their respective towns, but the fact remains you won\u2019t have enough to defend Keplavisk, if you stretch them out any more and quite frankly Keplavisk is the most important city if Rask has any hope of not descending into anarchic wilderness again. Some citizens of Keplavisk don\u2019t especially like the idea of \u201cimmigrants\u201d moving into their city, but the major accusation is that since the mayor of Keplavisk was killed (along with most of his immediate staff) in the last battle with the ED, you\u2019re about the closest thing to a leader. As such, some of the pessimists who claimed you would become a dictator with the powers that were given you at the start of the war are sort of becoming true.\n\nSo you ultimately play the role that was given you.\n\nThe first thing you do is call back all soldiers to Keplavisk and urge all other Raskians to do likewise. You say nobody has to come and you won\u2019t force anybody, but as of now, you\u2019re focusing only on Keplavisk and defense will be solely on the shoulders of the towns themselves.\n\nFortunately as a successful military leader, you\u2019re popular with the soldiers, so most of them return. Some originally lived in Keplavisk, some had no home any more, and some sensed a better life so they brought their families with them. With absolutely no more protection anymore, this has the bonus effect of bringing in non-military Raskians to Keplavisk as well though a lot aren\u2019t exactly happy about it.\n\nThe citizens that stubbornly stayed to rebuild their own homes didn\u2019t last too long. By the end of the year only a few of the villages far north (that were mostly spared the ravages of war anyway) exist as other beacons of civilization.\n\nKaplavisk on the other hand is transformed from a town half in ruins to a well defended prosperous city state by the end of that same year. No longer is town hall the \u201ccenter of government\u201d, but rather the military academy, which also serves as your new home. Defenses are as best as you can get them, sturdy walls, cannons, implementation of firearms and when you can draft them, people with minor magic powers to upkeep wards to prevent wendigos from sneaking into the city.\n\nTrue there are still the occasional protests about how there is much less \u201cfreedom\u201d now, but it never really gets out of hand. Well at least not yet. The major rabble-rouser unfortunately is Ulivik of all people. His years as a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d against the Eternal Dominion have changed a bit of his outlook on life, namely he sees that Rask won the war just only to be conquered by an Eternal anyway.\n\nYou tried to speak to him personally about this, but he seems firm in his beliefs. He states that when you trained him to be a mercenary even though you were tough, he still respected you. When you fought against the ED he mentions that his original worship of you almost returned as nobody did more to prevent them from taking over than you did.\n\nBut now that you\u2019ve allowed people to die without protection just because they wouldn\u2019t do what you say and turned his home into a police state he cannot just stand by and do nothing. He says he doesn\u2019t want to fight you for a couple reasons, but if it comes down to it, he will.\n\nHe\u2019s put you in a difficult position, which normally wouldn\u2019t be very difficult if he were anyone else. You have a slight soft spot for Ulivik, but that soft spot only goes so far. You\u2019ve got to deal with him some how because if you let him continue he\u2019ll gain more followers, despite his svelk origins. Capitulating to him isn\u2019t an option either, you start giving in now, you\u2019ll have to give in later, maybe not even to him, but others with similar ideas and you can\u2019t afford to start loosening up the reins. At least not anytime soon.\n\nYou need to come up with an idea before you can get some sleep tonight.", "action_results": [{"action": "Execution", "result": "It is with a heavy heart and regret that this has to be done, but the only way you\u2019re going make this problem go away is by making an example out of him. While it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll become a martyr, his \u201ccause\u201d is still manageable for your soldiers if a riot breaks out. After he\u2019s dead, it\u2019s unlikely anyone else will take up the mantle and those that might\u2019ve been on the fence will fall in line. Besides he\u2019s a svelk, who is going to shed many tears over him?\n\nHaving made this decision you finally get some sleep, though not very restful sleep.\n\nThe next day you order for Ulivik\u2019s arrest along with his main followers. This doesn\u2019t go over well. Ulivik refuses to be taken into custody and puts up a fight. A very good fight that involves him escaping completely and several soldiers dead.\n\nYou order a full manhunt for Ulivik, but he proves quite elusive. In the meantime you execute his followers, but this is when other citizens start expressing a dislike for how you\u2019re handling things. The major advantage you have is the military, but as you crack down harder, the soldiers become slightly overworked. Some of them even have their own disagreement with how you\u2019re doing things.\n\nBefore you know it you\u2019ve got small riots in the streets and Ulivik keeps popping up every now and then just to stir the chaos even more. Before you know it, work places like woodmills and mines have to shut down due to you having to keep more troops inside the city rather on the outside to protect the workers. It\u2019s all falling apart.\n\nYou put down riots, execute more people, but ultimately it all come to a head one late night in your own room.\n\nYou wake up and grab your weapon to see Ulivik lurking in the shadows. He\u2019s obviously snuck in, and most likely killed any guards nearby. Doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll either kill him or he\u2019ll kill you before anyone arrives.\n\n\u201cI figured it would come to this.\u201d You say and prepare for battle.\n\nThe two of you clash and you give him a good fight, but his youth, speed and dedication to his cause are an advantage, while you are old, slower and at this point you don\u2019t even care anymore.\n\nHe eventually slashes you across the chest and runs you through. You fall to the floor feeling the life drain from you.\n\n\u201cUgh\u2026shit that really hurts (cough).\u201d You say coughing up blood.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just give the people more freedom?\u201d Ulivik asksin a demanding tone. The strange thing is, in retrospect you don\u2019t have a really good answer except\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2026guess the old Eternal ways of (cough) domination and war just got the better of me\u2026heh knew there was a reason why I originally didn\u2019t try to become a tyrant all those years ago. It never ends well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way!\u201d Ulivik now exclaims almost as if he\u2019s holding back tears.\n\u201cMaybe\u2026but now\u2019s your chance to make it better.

He\u2019d most likely become a martyr and you\u2019d never be done fighting future uprisings in his name.\n\nYou then come up with an idea: Exile. If people are really unhappy here they can get the hell out and they can take their chances making it on their own. It has the potential to cause an exodus, but you doubt if it will. Not many with families will be willing to leave and it\u2019s still less harsh than execution. You are giving people a chance to live after all, it\u2019s up to them if they can survive in Rask without the benefit of protection or survive long enough for them to leave it entirely.\n\nNot killing dissidents, it\u2019s a radical idea in it\u2019s own right, but you\u2019re going to gamble on it.\n\nHaving made this decision you finally get some sleep, though not exactly restful sleep.\n\nThe next day when Ulivik is protesting with his little group in front of the academy you and several soldiers march up to him.\n\n\u201cOkay Ulivik, this ends today.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd so it begins, I was wondering when you\u2019d finally let loose and start threatening people for speaking out against you. That\u2019s what you used to do back in your Empire days isn\u2019t it?

I\u2019ve heard your complaints outside my window for the past several months, the least you can do is listen to me for a change.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, but this better be good.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t presume to tell me what is good, because this isn\u2019t a compromise. I\u2019m going to say this once and once only and this is going out to all of you. Any more dissension or acts of stirring up shit for no reason, and you\u2019re gone. And what I mean by gone, I mean exile. And not just you, I\u2019m talking ALL your family, all your friends and even your fucking pets. All of you that don\u2019t like how things are being run in this city, well you can get the fuck out. Let\u2019s see you do better out there. Lots of luck\u2026\u201d\n\nUlivik is a little surprised by your tactic, but it doesn\u2019t deter him and he gets in your face. You keep your soldiers back.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just throw people out of the city! These people have a right, we ALL have a right to live here and voice our concerns when the government is failing to provide a suitable quality of life!\u201d Ulivik exclaims.\n\u201cFailing? What the hell are you talking about? We\u2019re protecting everyone from bandits, monsters, eternal dominion hold outs and do I even need to mention the wendigos? Nobody starves, everyone has a job, and all people have to do is follow a few simple fucking rules. I\u2019m not demanding people bring me their virgin daughters! I\u2019m not having people routinely tortured for not believing in some religion! Yeah there have been some sacrifices like food rationing and curfews, but I\u2019ve been pretty damn fair about everything and YOU of all people should know that!\u201d\n\nUlivik stops for a moment and while it seems like he knows you have a point, he refuses to back down still. Perhaps you taught him too well.\n\n\u201cSo basically what you\u2019re saying is we should just be grateful that you\u2019re not Edgar\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the last straw, you lose your temper and proving you can still be quick for your age, you punch Ulivik in face. He staggers back and is disoriented enough for your soldiers to get a firm grip on him. He tries to twist free, but you have four soldiers lift him up grabbing one of his limbs each.\n\n\u201cLet me go tyrant! Too cowardly to face me in battle? So much for your eternal bravery!\u201d\n\u201cLucky for you, since you weren\u2019t even fast enough to dodge my punch, open the gates and throw his ass out. And if the rest of you want to join him, you can pack your shit and go too!\u201d\n\nAs you and the soldiers escort Ulivik out of the city, the rest of his followers lose their courage. Most of them have families and friends and aren\u2019t willing to risk your wrath anymore. Other citizens look on at the spectacle and just stare in silent awe. The only one making any sort of noise is Ulivik who is cursing you and everyone else who isn\u2019t helping him. You ignore his curses, and just simmer in anger at the situation.\n\nEventually you reach the gates and with a mighty heave your soldiers throw Ulivik a few feet and face first into the snow. He scrambles to get up and upon turning around; your soldiers draw several muskets on him.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Ulivik, don\u2019t come back or else I won\u2019t be as merciful next time.\u201d You say from the gate.\n\n\u201cMerciful? You\u2019re throwing me out of my own fucking home you bastard!\u201d\n\u201cAt least I\u2019m not throwing your mother out as well, and at least you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you. I can\u2019t believe I used to look up to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I never told you to, you chose to do that! And you chose this path as well. I\u2019m merely doing what I think is best, just like I did then. (sigh) I\u2019m sorry it has to be this way, but you\u2019ll survive Ulivik\u2026I know I taught you that\u2026close the gates.\u201d\n\nAs the gates close you see Ulivik just standing by himself looking very alone. It\u2019s sort of sad. He started out as a disliked \u201coutsider\u201d due to his race in this town when he was growing up and now he has at last been banished from it for good. Not even one of his so called followers or even a bystander pleaded for him or even joined him by leaving. He did a lot for Rask during the war and he was speaking out for their \u201crights\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t seem to account for shit in the scheme of things to people. While it\u2019s a fortunate situation, it still doesn\u2019t seem right even if he was opposing you.\n\nOver the next few months you half expect Ulivik to be attacking soldiers outside the gates of the city and holding some sort of one man vendetta or possibly even gathering a small group of bandits robbing the miners or loggers and such, but that doesn\u2019t happen. He\u2019s gone, but you\u2019re confident he\u2019s not dead. You just hope he\u2019s moved on to better things.\n\nAs for you and everyone else life goes on.\n\nYear 75\n\nWith age catching up on you every day you sometimes wonder if it\u2019s even worth getting out of bed anymore. You tire of the tedious act of governing, but you have no real successor to take your place. There are a couple of officers you have in mind, which could do a competent job you suppose, and that\u2019s when you make a major decision. You decide to step down from power and hand this mess over to someone else. Since you know whoever you pick is going to have to be a strong leader and nip any potential coups in the bud, you pick the three most charismatic, intelligent and loyal that you can think of and call them into the training area in front of an audience of soldiers.\n\nYou then announce that the three men will fight to the death and whoever is left standing gets to be in charge. The three officers look a little surprised and the audience is silent, but it doesn\u2019t take long for one of the men to try to sneak attack on one of the others.\n\nThe fight is a good one. As you watch you fight back to the days when you watched your classmates fight each other for Mistress. That was so long ago and as crazy as it seems you\u2019ve actually been missing those days lately, everything much simpler at least. All of them are gone now. Last you heard of Edgar is that he was assassinated four years ago as the Eternal Dominion continued to fragment into petty fiefdoms ruled by equally petty eternal warlords. You don\u2019t know about Warrick or Brenda, but you sometimes like to think they managed to escape the madness and are living satisfying lives. Barring that, you hope they died well in whatever battle that was their last.\n\nEventually one man is left standing. Bruised, bloody and battered, but victorious. It is at this point you stand up and congratulate him and make another announcement to the crowd.\n\n\u201cCaptain Eddings has proved himself worthy of succeeding me. I trust you will serve this man as well as you have served me all these years. Congratulations Eckers, you\u2019ve just been promoted to\u2026uh general I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir, I will do everything in my power to ensure the safety and prosperity of the city.\u201d Eddings remarks with pride.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you will, I\u2019m sure you will, why don\u2019t you head to the infirmary first though. As for me I\u2019m going back to sleep. You can catch up with me later if you need some explanation on anything, but I left some notes on my desk for you as a general guideline.\u201d You say and head back to your room.\n\nYou know you\u2019ll probably still be running things for a while at least and probably be consulted many times, but you still feel as if a weight has been lifted off you. The problem is, you wonder how you\u2019ll spend your free time. You\u2019ll think of something you suppose.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Take a harder job", "result": "Nothing like trial by fire, if Ulivik thinks he can handle it, he\u2019ll learn soon enough.\n\n\u201cKenneth just give us whatever job pays the most currently right now.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh okay then, that\u2019s easy. There\u2019s a troll somewhere south of here near the old Empire border. Dunno exactly where he\u2019s making his home, I\u2019m guess there\u2019s a hole in the ground somewhere though, anyway it\u2019s been eating a lot of travelers and merchants on the roads whenever it\u2019s feeling a little hungry. It\u2019s only just arrived, but it\u2019s hurting business and for some reason none of these fucking cowards will go and kill it!\u201d Kenneth shouts so everyone in the bar can hear him.\n\n\u201cA troll? Where the hell did he come from? They\u2019re rare enough as it is, and even less likely to wander around above ground.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cI have no idea, but it\u2019s ruining business. So are you going to take the job?\u201d\n\u201cYeah sure, should be interesting.\u201d You say.\n\nYou and Ulivik get up and leave who looks less enthusiastic now.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cOh uh, nothing. Just didn\u2019t expect it would be a troll. You only hear about them in stories.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well this ain\u2019t no story and they\u2019re quite real. I should know I\u2019ve fought one before when I was serving as a soldier here. Damn thing blended in the darkness of the cave and took out three men before we even knew what was going on. Now it\u2019s a common misconception that you can only kill them with fire, but that\u2019s probably the best way to kill \u2018em anyway given how tough their skin is, let alone their regenerative abilities\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Ulivik begins to look pale, an amazing feat for a dark elf.

Do you want to back out?\u201d\n\nUlivik\u2019s silence isn\u2019t an answer.\n\n\u201cLook, you better tell me now because when we\u2019re facing nine feet of green and black horror I don\u2019t want to be having to pull your fat out of the fire because you\u2019re freezing up in terror.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not backing out and I won\u2019t freeze up!\u201d he exclaims.\n\u201cOkay then, come on we need to get a few extra supplies.\u201d\n\nUlivik\u2019s answer doesn\u2019t exactly convince you that he still isn\u2019t scared about all this, but sometimes fear can be a good thing. Keeps you on your toes. Besides one would have to be a complete moron to not be a little worried about facing a troll. The only time you faced one, wasn\u2019t exactly a picnic and you had the advantage of numbers on your side. Normally you don\u2019t waste your money on things like explosives, but you make an exception and buy a couple of firebombs along with some oil flasks, torches and a whetstone to make sure your sword is extra sharp.\n\nAlong the way to your destination, you tell Ulivik how he should approach fighting the thing and whatever he does to not let it corner him or get the drop on him. If either one happens he\u2019s dead. You also tell him that unlike an ogre or a giant, trolls are a lot faster and sneakier than their size would indicate.\n\nYou travel for about a good portion of the day on your way towards the southern Rask border. You stick to the road since you figure if the troll has been ambushing merchants and travelers, he\u2019s got to be stalking the road. When night comes you make a camp along side of it, but there still is no sign of any troll yet.\n\n\u201cHey you said these things don\u2019t usually come out from underground?\u201d Ulivik asks.\n\u201cWell the one I encountered was living in a cave that was being mined, and all the other stories I\u2019ve heard and you\u2019ve probably heard is that they\u2019re completely subterranean. Whatever the truth is, this one has been lurking above ground and out in the open, so maybe they just don\u2019t like sunlight. Probably has a home somewhere nearby, but there aren\u2019t any hills or mountains in this part of Rask, just forest. Could be living in there I suppose, but I\u2019m betting he\u2019s probably got a hidden entrance in the ground somewhere and he\u2019s living right underneath us.\u201d\n\nThis of course causes Ulivik to start looking at the ground around him.\n\n\u201cHow do we know it\u2019ll even show up?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t, but if it\u2019s been attacking people like Kenneth says it has, then us lingering around the road will probably draw its attention. Of course there\u2019s no point in sitting around and using up all our energy by staying up all night. We\u2019ll be taking shifts. You seem to be alert already so you\u2019re taking first watch while I get a little rest.\u201d\n\nWhen you close your eyes you begin to slowly drift off, though you\u2019ve always been sort of a light sleeper, so you never really fall into a deep sleep. What wakes you up completely is a sickening cracking sound and heavy breathing.\n\nYou stand up with your sword in hand and you\u2019re just in time to see a large gangly figure with its hands around Ulivik\u2019s head which is now completely backwards. He didn\u2019t even have a chance. Seeing you, the troll emits a low growl and drops Ulivik\u2019s body. The troll lurches and leaps about in a chaotic manner. It tries to circle you in such a way that it\u2019ll be behind you, but you don\u2019t allow that to happen. Eventually it gets frustrated and attacks you head on.\n\nFighting the troll is harder than the last time you fought one before and not just due to the fact that you had back up. The open space of the outside world is actually more beneficial for the troll\u2019s fighting style which is jerky and involves a lot of leaping around. Many times the creature manages to smash you with its hardened fists due to its extended reach alone. Feels like getting hit by fucking battering ram.\n\nYour own hits against it don\u2019t seem to do anything, except the one time when you actually manage to cleave one of the troll\u2019s legs off just below the knee. This doesn\u2019t deter its attack though. It merely backs off long enough for it to change its fighting style. It comes at you on all fours (or rather threes in this case). During this time you\u2019ve taken the opportunity to light up one of the firebombs to throw at the thing, but by the time you light it, it\u2019s already upon you and knocked you down. Pinnining you to the ground as best it can, the troll punches you in the face, breaking your nose to a point where it practically explodes into a mess of blood. You gasps for air as it follows up by sinking its teeth deep into your sword arm. The sound of bone cracking is a sure sign that it won\u2019t be long before the troll chews it off completely.\n\nIn the meantime the firebomb you lit fell close by and its fuse is still burning down. Somehow between your eyes covered in blood, the difficulty breathing and the pain wracking your entire body while a troll is eating you alive, you manage to grab the firebomb with your good arm and hold it right near the troll\u2019s head.\n\nYou get a minor satisfaction at the troll\u2019s expression when he sees the bomb just before it goes off, blowing the pair of you up.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Don't take Ulivik", "result": "While it\u2019s an interesting possibility, you\u2019re not training soldiers anymore; you\u2019re done with that mess and quite frankly, you doubt if Ulivik would make a good warrior of any kind.\n\n\u201cLook kid, I\u2019ve put up with you for quite some time now, but enough is enough. I told you, go down to Kenneth\u2019s Rest and get a job. If you\u2019re too much of a sissy to disobey your parents, then you ain\u2019t gonna have what it takes to be a merc in the first place. Now leave me the hell alone, or I\u2019m gonna hurt you very very badly and you don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nUlivik tries to beg some more, but after a few menacing glares and threatening steps towards him, he backs off, saddened by your hostility. Having gotten rid of Ulivik, you set off for a different town further north, they\u2019re always having problems up there.\n\nA few months later when you\u2019re back in Keplavisk, you fully expect Ulivik to be bothering you again, but you see no sign of him which is odd since he always seems to know exactly when you come into town. While getting a drink at the tavern you ask the barkeep in passing where he is.\n\n\u201cOh that dark elven boy? Ran off and got himself killed a couple months ago. Damn fool was trying to be a mercenary and I guess some bandits finally taught him that he wasn\u2019t. Good riddance I say. Don\u2019t need any of their kind around, didn\u2019t like \u2018em when they were doing thug work for the Empire\u2026erm, no offence Mr. Bane\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm, just gimme my drink.\u201d You say.\n\nWhile Ulivik\u2019s death doesn\u2019t affect you on any emotional level, you are a little surprised to hear about it. You didn\u2019t think he actually would have the heart to try to strike out on his own. Oh well, that\u2019s how it is in this business though, one moment you\u2019re here the next you aren\u2019t. Everything is fleeting and you can\u2019t worry about tomorrow, you just have to live for today.\n\nLife for you continues on as usual.\n\nYear 50\n\nYou wake up from another night of debauchery and predictably you feel pretty terrible from it. Your head hurts and your body aches all over, of course your body would ache anyway. The years have been taking a toll on how you push yourself physically and the battles you fight. The excessive parties in between really don\u2019t help though.\n\nYou just lay in bed for a while dreading the fact that you\u2019ll be running out of coin soon again and have to go to work again. It\u2019s an endless cycle, and while the freedom you\u2019ve enjoyed since leaving the Empire has been nice, the past couple of years you\u2019ve started feel like something is missing. Namely purpose and direction. The Empire had numerous faults, but in the beginning it did give you such things and part of you misses it.\n\nYou begin to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t go join Edgar in his Eternal Dominion or maybe offer to serve the Felkan Kingdom to give yourself some sort of goal larger than yourself. You quickly dismiss such thoughts though for several reasons, one of the biggest ones being that you now you\u2019ve had your taste of freedom, you don\u2019t really want to be following orders from a large government again. (Let alone Edgar)\n\nOf course maybe you just need a change of scenery and just leave this area entirely. There certainly nothing really tying you down except perhaps your own comfort of familiarity. You\u2019ve spent more than half of your life in Rask, hell it\u2019s actually been more of your \u201chome\u201d than the Empire ever was so despite your emotional disconnect with people, you \u2018re a little attached to the area.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave Rask", "result": "You\u2019ve lived in Rask as an \u201coccupier\u201d and as a \u201ccitizen\u201d and neither one have really fulfilled you. You decide that it might very well be time to leave. You have no idea where you\u2019re going to go or what you\u2019re going to do, but you guess you\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\n\nYou pack up what belongings you can carry and do a little shopping for other necessities before you set off on your journey. When you eventually get to the Rask border, you take a look back, wondering if you\u2019ll ever return one day\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t.\n\nYou spend your remaining years traveling far from Rask, far from old Empire territory and far from any land you\u2019ve ever known. While some of it is interesting, you still never feel \u201ccontent.\u201d You mostly support yourself just by living off the land and doing some occasional mercenary work when passing through towns and villages. You never do settle down in one area for long though.\n\nYou might be an Eternal and your fighting spirit is always willing, but that doesn\u2019t stop the ravages of time from taking their toll on your body. Between the constant traveling and the combat, your body is aching all the time. You aren\u2019t as fast or as strong as you used to be and you often forget you aren\u2019t young anymore, or more likely you have full knowledge of it and are just too stubborn to change.\n\nYour unwillingness to settle down and die peacefully in your bed eventually catches up with you during a mercenary job you take in some small town in a far away land. Bandits are raiding the town on a regular basis and you take part in defending it. You do well enough for a man your age, but ultimately you are brought down by several of them who manage to surround and gain the advantage over you.\n\nYou fall to several sword blows to your body and collapse in a bloody heap in the streets of the town.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stick around", "result": "You may be in a \u201crut\u201d but you realize you\u2019re too old to just start all over again, somewhere else and quite frankly you don\u2019t really want to. Rask is your home now, and while life might not be perfect here, it\u2019s a lot better than how your life was during the Empire. You just need to push that lingering Empire indoctrination from your mind that you thought was gone.\n\nYou roll out of bed and get yourself in the frame of mind to go to work again\u2026\n\nYear 54\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I killed the last giant in Rask! Another round!\u201d you exclaim as everyone in the tavern hangs on your every word. Later you continue your tradition of bedding whatever wench that is pretty enough and willing that night.\n\nThe past four years have been relatively good for you, or at least you\u2019ve been trying to make the best of them. Since your last self reflection you\u2019ve funneled your energy in not only your mercenary work, but to be the best one in Rask by deliberately taking on the most dangerous jobs as well as blatantly stealing jobs from other mercs. While this has made you a lot more famous with the average citizens who appreciate your monster and bandit slaying, it\u2019s also made you quite unpopular with all the rest of the mercs.\n\nNaturally this unpopularity puts a target on your back and while most of the mercs are far too scared to actually to confront you face to face they do eventually build up a coalition to take you out once and for all.\n\nOne day on your way to take out what you believe to be a bandit hideout, you\u2019re traveling into a wooded area and get the impression that something is amiss, like you\u2019re walking into an ambush.\n\nAt first you think it might be the bandits who caught on to you, but you\u2019ve dealt with too many of those types to know that they\u2019re either too stupid to lay an ambush or they\u2019re smart enough to have already run away.\n\nThat\u2019s when you draw your sword\u2026\n\n\u201cAlright, I know you\u2019re all out there! I guess this has been a long time coming, so let\u2019s get this shit over. The merc population needs a little thinning out anyway.\u201d You shout.\n\nPredictably Flog comes out hiding with a motley group of humans and even a couple of ogres he must\u2019ve intimidated into joining him.\n\n\u201cFlog told you he\u2019d kill you one day! Today is da day!\u201d\n\u201cTook you long enough and you still need a group to help you\u2026\u201d you hear the crunch of a twig behind you and you instinctively duck and roll to your left as several bolts go flying into trees narrowly missing you.\n\n\u201cReload!\u201d you hear a female svelk voice shout while you run for cover behind some rocks.\n\u201cHey! This is Flog\u2019s kill! Told you not to try to kill him, just prevent his escape!\u201d\n\u201cHah! You got Eldolith to help you? You working for orcs now Eldy? My how far you\u2019ve come from once working for the Empire!\u201d you mock.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be laughing for too much longer Eternal. You\u2019ve stolen your last job from us!\u201d Eldolith shouts back.\n\nWhile you hide behind the rocks, Flog orders some of the other mercs to go after you, doesn\u2019t take any time for you at all to kill several of them. Eldolith orders another volley of bolts from her men, but you use a merc you grabbed as a shield and run deeper in the forest.\n\nFlog\u2019s ogres run after you and thanks to their great stamina, they manage to catch up to you before long, you stop your running, spin around and with as much force as you can you chop at one of the ogre\u2019s legs. He doesn\u2019t stop in time and you nearly chop it completely off, unfortunately he crashes into you bellowing in pain the whole time. You crawl out from under the one leg ogre and finish him off, only to have his buddy nearly cave your head in with his club.\n\nYou shove your dagger upwards into the ogre\u2019s balls and his low growls and snarls become high-pitched squeaks as his manhood is now shredded. He falls to his knees and before you can finish him off, the svelks arrive with their blasted repeating crossbows again. A couple take aim immediately while two others attempt to run around behind you. Having little in the way of options you run to the nearest tree for cover and try to get close enough to cut one of them down.\n\nYou succeed in dodging and reaching the first two, who put up a poor showing of swordsmanship, but the other two that ran around in back of you fire their own volleys and you feel the piercing pain of two bolts going into your left leg and another going into your back. You collapse on top of one of the other dead svelk. The pain is coursing throughout your body, but you\u2019re in a vulnerable position, and in order to survive you can only hope you\u2019re fast enough to get the drop on them.\n\nPlaying dead you rely on your hearing to sense how close the svelk are stepping through the snow to check on you. This is harder than in sounds with a severely wounded ogre moaning about his wounds the whole time. You also see two other images running towards you, it\u2019s Flog and Eldolith. You can\u2019t wait any longer.\n\nYou grab one of the dead svelk\u2019s crossbows and with all your strength you roll on your back (Biting your lip at the pain due to the bolt there) and fire at the surprised svelks moving towards you. You were never an expert on ranged weapons, but you don\u2019t miss at your range and the two svelk go down. You then point it at the balless ogre and put him out of his misery with a single bolt to his head.\n\n\u201cShit! He\u2019s got one of the crossbows!\u201d Eldolith shouts and pulls out her own with taking cover. Flog on the other hand doesn\u2019t seem particularly worried.\n\n\u201cNo more hiding! Flog put an end to Bane once and for all!\u201d he yells and charged at you with his axe. You shoot your remaining bolts at him, but only succeed in hitting Flog in the arm, which barely stops his stride. You scramble to get up and throw the crossbow at Flog who bats away the oncoming object.\n\nFlog swings his axe and catches you with a glancing blow to your chest, ripping your armor and breaking the skin. You stagger backwards trying not to fall again.\n\n\u201cYooze gonna die today Bane! Ha ha ha ha ha!\u201d Flog laughs followed by a sudden yell of pain as he feels several bolts go into his own back. He immediately stops his advance on you and falls to one knee coughing up blood.\n\n\u201cTraitorous dark elven bitch!\u201d he shouts.\n\nThis gives you enough time to stagger away again and grab another one of the dead svelk crossbows and hide again. You aren\u2019t feeling so great yourself; you know the svelk bolts probably were dipped in some sort of poison. In fact you\u2019re surprised it hasn\u2019t incapacitated you yet. You just hope you can get through this quick enough to drag yourself back to the closest town.\n\nYou look out from behind your cover just in time to see Flog attempting to advance on Eldolith and her firing another volley into his body. She ends up having to step back quite a bit and reload again before finally finishing him off. He falls backwards into the snow looking like a pin cushion.\n\n\u201cBad move Eldy. Should\u2019ve let Flog wear me down a lot more and then killed him.\u201d You shout.\n\u201cWear you down? Hah, he would\u2019ve killed you, in your current condition. No, I want the pleasure of killing you myself.\u201d\n\nWhile she pontificates you attempt to shoot at her from behind your cover, but you miss.\n\n\u201cNice try. How are you feeling over there Bane? Not too good I imagine. Had to make sure the poison was really strong, I know how you Eternals got that annoying resistance to the stuff.\u201d\n\nAt this point, you are indeed starting to feel quite unwell. You begin to feel nauseous and you\u2019re having a hard time standing up. When you begin retching, you hear Eldolith speak again.\n\n\u201cYou know Bane, this is near the same area where I helped your old captain kill all those elves. That was a good day too. You\u2019re starting to sound pretty bad over there Bane, how about you just give yourself up and let me finish you off? Wouldn\u2019t you rather be killed by a worthy foe rather than just succumb to the poison? There\u2019s no shame in being beaten by your betters.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re running out of time and you know it.\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026you got a point damn you. I\u2019m coming out, here I\u2019ll throw out the crossbow just to reassure you!\u201d you shout and throw your crossbow from behind your cover.\n\u201cGood, good, glad to see you submitting to the inevitable. Now come out slowly.\u201d\n\nThe way you\u2019re feeling right now, you doubt if you could come out any other way. You see Eldolith pointing her crossbow at you while stepping out from her own cover and moving closer towards you. She smirks and in typical svelk fashion can\u2019t help but gloat.\n\n\u201cI must say I am surprised that you decided to surrender, I would\u2019ve thought your eternal pride would\u2019ve prevented such a thing. But I guess those days are long gone just like the Empire you once served eh?\u201d\n\u201cJust get this over with.\u201d You say and then fall to your hands and knees in the snow vomiting up blood.\n\u201cMmm, perhaps I\u2019ll enjoy watching you squirm some more. The once great Bane of Rask finally\u2026\u201d\n\nYou knew you could count on Eldolith being a typical svelk. While she\u2019s taunting you, she doesn\u2019t pay attention that your hands are doing something rather simple such as balling up the hardened snow. With all your strength you throw the snowball at her. Being caught off guard she dodges it and shoots wildly at you. You manage to roll out of the way and grab the crossbow you threw away. You unload the entire thing at her and as luck would have it, the bolts land true for the most part. Three of them go into her side and another into her neck.\n\nShe falls into the snow coughing up blood and holding on to her side. You hear her cursing you with her dying breaths as you attempt to leave the area. While you have won, you know you aren\u2019t going to survive too much longer.\n\nYou manage to crawl a few more meters before the poison finally takes it toll. Your last thoughts are nostalgic ones. You allow yourself to smile at the times you got to enjoy life and your past victories, even this one.

Ulivik was that lucky rarity that a human couple that couldn\u2019t have any children of their own literally stumbled upon him in the woods.\n\nOther than that, he hasn\u2019t exactly been all that lucky. Given the reputation of his kind, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he\u2019s practically run off or insulted everywhere he goes. How his adopted parent\u2019s business hasn\u2019t suffered is amazing, but it\u2019s a small enough town that people understand that the couple was trying for a child for a very long time and keep their dislike for the svelk youth to a minimum. Doesn\u2019t stop other youths from being complete bastards to him though.\n\nPerhaps due to his outcast nature he\u2019s latched on to the idea of a mercenary life of being a glorious life of excitement and adventure. Naturally when he found out that you were one of the best mercenaries in the region, he attached himself to you almost immediately and whenever you\u2019re in town, he asks you a bunch of questions.

Again, the only one you know of any note is the Felkan Kingdom. You only know a little about them based on the propaganda the Empire has told you as well as the brief conversation you had with Gerald when you temporarily reunited with him.\n\nTechnically the Empire is at peace with the Felkan Kingdom, but there are still skirmishes. Though nowdays it\u2019s due to rogue Empire soldiers (and peasants too) becoming outright bandits rather than any patriotic reason.

You see in the middle of the town square several heads stuck on pikes with their eyes gouged out, some of them of children.

You of course don\u2019t know the whole story, but quite frankly you don\u2019t even want to know. All this revelation does is make you want to get out of Empire lands as quick as possible because it seems like it really was ever good for is turning everybody into a wannabe sovereign.\n\nYou hasten your pace to the Felkan border as you don\u2019t wish to have any potential conflict with this new \u201cregime\u201d that seems to be trying to form here. It\u2019s a shame, because you did think about trying to find Edgar before going to the border hoping that maybe he\u2019d join you. Now? He\u2019d probably try to convince you to join him.

We should\u2019ve just marched in and took it when they were begging for peace!\u201d Wally adds\n\nThe one soldier\u2019s words are most interesting. Especially how he speaks about his ruler so freely and without fear. It is apparent that despite their dislike of their ruler, yet they are very dedicated to their nation. It is sort of a comforting thing to see after so many you\u2019ve encountered over the years weren\u2019t. Perhaps you could find a place here, assuming you can get past this first obstacle.\n\n\u201cVery well gentlemen the only thing I can tell you that might convince you, is that I am an Eternal, born and bred for combat. I say with no boast that I am the best of my kind and while I am not yet familiar with your weapons, I dare say my combat skill and knowledge would allow me to learn rather quickly. All I ask is that I be allowed to speak with someone with more authority so that I can be given a proper chance.\u201d\n\u201cEternal? You ain\u2019t no Eternal, you\u2019re way too old. I\u2019ve seen those bastards running around on the other side of the border and they\u2019re either in their twenties or younger. Dunno why you\u2019d claim to be one of them for anyway, they\u2019re not even human, they\u2019re fucking soulless monsters. Heard enough horror stories from all the refugees we have to turn away. Some of those stories\u2026pretty heartbreaking stuff\u2026\u201d Harry says getting a little choked about one of the stories he seems to be thinking about. It\u2019s at that point one of his buddies pipes up.\n\u201cHey, uh maybe he\u2019s one of those OTHER Eternals.\u201d\n\u201cOh an original?

And?\u201d\n\u201cI know him seeing as we practically grew up together. He was believed to be dead, how is it that he\u2019s a captain in the Felkan military?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well perhaps you can ask him that yourself, if you really do know him. Okay change of plan, we\u2019ll take you to see Captain Warrick, but you better not try anything funny. We\u2019ll need you to get off that horse and hand over your weapons. Chuck and Wally, you\u2019re with me, the rest of you keep an eye on the border as usual, we\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\nYou comply with their demands and have them march you to Fort Soot. The thing you notice immediately are all the trenches built into the land. Left overs from the war you imagine. When you get to Fort Soot it isn\u2019t particularly large, though it does seem to be heavily defended with weapons you\u2019ve heard about before. Cannons they\u2019re called, and they are very devastating. You remember Gerald telling you how they could destroy stone golems as if they were made of paper. Makes you wonder why for all it\u2019s power that the Empire didn\u2019t fund money and time into developing such wonders as it certainly would\u2019ve helped a lot more than their Eternal project. You quietly chuckle at the irony of that thought briefly thinking what you would\u2019ve been doing now if there hadn\u2019t been such a project. Probably not marching into a Felkan fort that\u2019s for sure.\n\nWhen you are brought into Warrick\u2019s office it\u2019s like a trip to the past. Warrick\u2019s changed quite a bit. He\u2019s wearing an eyepatch for one thing and he\u2019s lost most of his hair, but you\u2019d still recognize him. He also recognizes you though he\u2019s still having trouble believing it.\n\n\u201cBy the gods, is it really you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. By the gods? Not by the Emperor anymore I see.\u201d\n\u201cNope and never will be again, which brings me to my next question. Why have you come here? I certainly hope it isn\u2019t on some fool mission to bring me to justice for being a traitor\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHa ha. Maybe at one time, but not anymore either. I guess you could say, I\u2019m also a traitor, though I don\u2019t think I am. The Empire betrayed itself a long time ago and I can\u2019t serve a place that has not even the slightest concept of honor or loyalty even if it was the one that taught me such ideals.\u201d\n\u201cI must say, I am a little surprised that you of all people would come to that conclusion. You were the most dedicated of all of us. I know that you are telling the truth though, as you were never a liar. So you\u2019ve left the Empire then and come here to\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cPledge myself to the Felkan Kingdom, though it seems I wasn\u2019t the only one who had that idea.\u201d\n\u201cHah, yeah a bit of a long story that. Before we continue I\u2019ll have to clear this with a lot of people first, and you\u2019re probably going to have to prove yourself several times, but if you\u2019re serious about this then you\u2019ll most likely be accepted. I\u2019ve found things work with a little more leniency in the Felkan Kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cAll I want is a new chance.\u201d\n\nAnd so began your service to the Felkan Kingdom.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Chapter 3A2: For the Kingdom!\n\n\nYear 40\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the hell we haven\u2019t just gone marching into the Arat province and taken it from the Eternal Dominion. We have superior weaponry, and they aren\u2019t even that organized. I don\u2019t care how skilled they are in combat, they can\u2019t stop a bullet.\u201d A soldier complains.\n\u201cSo, do you think we\u2019ll really be going to war again?\u201d his buddy asks.\n\u201cIs there any fucking doubt? The Empire might be dead, but that Eternal Dominion or whatever it\u2019s called took its place and from what I can gather the ones running that are complete monsters. No small feat considering how the Empire was run\u2026uh no offense sarge.\u201d\n\nYou shake your head as a sign that you could care less how they discuss the Empire, as you\u2019re busy keeping on the look out for potential enemies and you tell them to stop talking and do likewise. Felkan soldiers tend to be a little more chatty than you\u2019re used to, they also tend to be a little over confident in battle at times due to their reliance on firearms. Their melee skills aren\u2019t bad, but they aren\u2019t anywhere near those of a say an Empire soldier, let alone an Eternal. You learned how to handle a musket pretty quickly, but much like the same reason you avoided using bows and such, ranged combat just isn\u2019t quite your thing. Still, you appreciate their destructive power and having an advantage so you have no problems carrying around a couple of flintlock pistols on your person.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s different is a government that isn\u2019t actually interested in conquest despite its people often expressing such desires. You\u2019ve never met the king or any of the royals, but from what you\u2019ve heard the king is more of a scholar rather than a warrior ruler. Some consider this a weakness, but you aren\u2019t convinced that it is. The king apparently believes conquest would just drain the coffers of what is currently a healthy economy (despite a recent war) and it\u2019s better to put that money to other uses. The Felkans in general are always looking for new ways to advance the quality of life for all through scientific advancement. You don\u2019t remember that sort of thing in the Empire where the status quo was law. While magic was reserved for the elite and still not common in the Empire, it\u2019s practically non-existent in the Felkan Kingdom, which might explain their tendency towards scientific endeavors. Well that, and the fact that a good number of gnomes live among them who probably produce most of the great inventions in the kingdom.\n\nStill, you often hear a lot of criticism about the king; sometimes it makes you wonder if there shouldn\u2019t be cause for concern. If this were the Empire you would\u2019ve been expected to harshly discipline all of those soldiers that insulted the Emperor. Here, there is a lot more freedom in what you can say.\n\nYes, there are so many differences from the Empire and you often feel out of place. Hell you feel strange enough only being a sergeant again. Five years and they still haven\u2019t felt that you warrant a promotion to a higher rank, you don\u2019t know why they still don\u2019t trust you as much as they trust Warrick considering he actually fought against them directly. Of course he actually saved the lives of some important Felkan royals, so that\u2019s probably the reason.\n\nThey don\u2019t keep you stationed on the frontlines of the Arat border like they do with Warrick either, for the past several years you\u2019ve been stationed at a fort at the other end of the kingdom, though the fort is so small it\u2019s more like an outpost. Fort Green is located near a small village called Blossomdale and that\u2019s basically what you\u2019ve been defending. It\u2019s a rather dull assignment and only broken up by the occasional skirmishes with gnolls, bandits or other denizens living in the untouched forests and the hills. You\u2019ve tried to make the best of things. You keep your mind mostly focused on your job like you always do.\n\nOne good thing is that the soldiers that serve under you don\u2019t seem to mind your Eternal origins, but you do get the impression they\u2019re a little afraid of you. Your superior officer Captain Eckers seems okay with you as well. He\u2019s the only one stationed here that\u2019s older than you and probably sees you as someone he has a little more in common with, not to mention you bring a little more discipline to the fort and encourage more drilling and combat training.\n\nEventually your shift is over and as usual, nothing happened today. Your replacements take over your post and you make your way back to the fort. The rest of the soldiers head to Blossumdale presumably for a little R&R as they often do.\n\nWhen you get back to the fort, somebody tells you that Captain Eckers wants to see you, so you proceed to his office.\n\n\u201cHave a seat sergeant. So was today any different than yesterday? Any hostiles to be dispatched or anything?\u201d\n\u201cNo sir, things were quiet as usual.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI figured as much. It\u2019s been like this for the past eight months. You know it\u2019s always been slow around here, but lately\u2026(sigh) I don\u2019t know. I suppose we should be glad this place isn\u2019t under attack constantly, but the boredom of nothing to do is frustrating.\u201d\n\u201cI know the feeling sir.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, I\u2019ll bet. Bred for war and all that\u2026you once had a command at a fort at one time did you not?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir I did, in Rask.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard about that area. I\u2019ll bet you never ran out of fighting up there.\u201d\n\u201cWell sir, we sort of did since I did my best to try to exterminate the most dangerous threats. For a while things got slow then we had a series of uprisings became a problem and I had to be in involved in putting those down so I wasn\u2019t quite as bored anymore.\u201d\n\u201cUprisings. Now that would be an interesting event, though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite that bored yet. Still, I wonder if one wouldn\u2019t do some good. Get those royals off their asses and actually do something for a change.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they do what they can\u2026the land is prosperous after all.\u201d You say unsure of how to react and still wondering why you were called in here.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know, but really what good is that going to do when the Eternal Dominion comes beating down our door? I served on the front lines of the war with the Empire from beginning to end, and I saw shit that even I wasn\u2019t prepared to see. Even with our technological advantage, sometimes I don\u2019t know how we managed to hold the Empire off\u2026I guess you guys really had a lot of internal problems.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes we did sir. A lot.\u201d\n\u201cRight, and that\u2019s the only reason why we held out. If the Empire had been a united front like it used to be\u2026 well me and you probably wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, if I may interject for a moment. I have heard citizens and soldiers on more than one occasion suggest that the Felkan Kingdom should become more aggressive. I\u2019m puzzled to as why if things are going well. after all the Empire engaged in continual conquest and I think we know how that turned out.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a point about the Empire, but you also should remember the Empire lasted several centuries before collapsing. I don\u2019t presume to know exactly all the problems you had, but I can tell you what the problems we have are and why the people are getting sick of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are those sir?\u201d\n\u201cFucking gnomes.\u201d\n\u201cGnomes? Don\u2019t they provide all the wonderful inventions for this Kingdom?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and they also have been using us as protection for decades and the royals are in their fucking pockets. We aren\u2019t really ruled by the royals, the damned gnomish inventors and businessmen rule us. They don\u2019t want us expanding too much, because then we just might be harder to control. They also don\u2019t want us to become too strong militarily because we just might turn it against them. I mean hell, I think you\u2019ve seen how our soldiers aren\u2019t exactly the best fighters and rely on firearms. I shudder to think if we ever had to actually fight without them. It didn\u2019t always used to be that way, at least not back in my day. That\u2019s why you\u2019re a damn breath of fresh air. You\u2019re actually a REAL warrior.\u201d\n\nYou just sit and listen as the captain begins getting even angrier during his rant.\n\n\u201cYou know why I\u2019m stationed here in the ass end of nowhere? Because I spoke my mind on what I thought about gnomes and suggested we needed to stop being pussies and actually start taking more land. I mean take this place for example. If we had just a couple more platoons, and the orders, we could march into those hills nearby and wipe out all those damned gnolls for good. But what do we do instead? Wait around for the fuckers to attack us then sit here with our thumbs up our asses until they rebuild and do it all over again. We\u2019re better than that! Or at least we used to be!\u201d at this point Captain Eckers slams his fist on his desk. He\u2019s silent with his head looking down for a moment and then looks up to address you.\n\n\u201c\u2026forgive me sergeant, I get a little emotional about this stuff sometimes. I really shouldn\u2019t. Thank you for your report and listening. I just need someone to speak my mind to sometimes\u2026anyway dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou get up and leave, thinking about what has transpired.\n\nIt basically sounds like the captain doesn\u2019t believe in his government anymore. You know what that\u2019s like, but you just aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s as bad as he\u2019s claiming or he\u2019s just a bitter old man that\u2019s mad because times changed and he pissed off the wrong people in charge of his career. However as you\u2019re reminded he isn\u2019t the only person you\u2019ve heard speaking out, he just happens to be the only one that\u2019s gone into more detail than you\u2019re used to.\n\nYou also wonder if he told you all this stuff for a reason, is he hinting for you to do something? And what could you do? You\u2019re a lower rank than him and not exactly high on the hierarchy. You\u2019re also pretty much an outsider. Stirring up trouble isn\u2019t exactly something you should be doing, and you pledged yourself to serve the kingdom and its king, not overthrow it. If you were going to be doing that, you might as well have joined the Eternal Dominion.\n\nYou aren\u2019t sure of what to make of all this gnome business though, if that is even true. You\u2019ve never paid too much attention to them being in a lot of the positions of power. Part of you though does make you wonder about who you\u2019re really serving and if it is really the gnomes like the captain claims, then your whole oath to the kingdom is pretty much a joke. Then again if they really are controlling everything, does it really make a difference? Things seem to still be running well and you personally just don\u2019t have any real proof that there is some conspiracy even though it wouldn\u2019t surprise you too much if there was one going on.\n\nOne thing you know though, if others are feeling like the captain does, this isn\u2019t going to go away. This is going to get worse; in fact it may already be too late to stop something from occurring. You could very well find yourself serving in another collapsing government again.", "action_results": [{"action": "Report to the captain", "result": "You don\u2019t know if this is actually going to do any good, but if the captain ever decides to suddenly secede from the Felkan Kingdom, you want someone to know that you weren\u2019t part of it from the beginning. The problem there isn\u2019t a higher-ranking officer at the fort and you don\u2019t really know anybody that you could report this to. You suppose you write a letter to Major Samuels at Fort Smoke. He\u2019s in charge of the whole Ibim province, but then you think what if he feels the same way as the captain? If that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d probably become hated not just at your fort, but in other circles as well. You\u2019d possibly even be demoted or worse. You\u2019ve managed to make a life here with minimal friction, and you\u2019d hate to just throw that all away, but you have to do something. For good or ill your duty is to the kingdom now and you need to defend against all potential threats, external and internal, and from your experience the internal ones are the worst.\n\nThat\u2019s when you come up with the idea that you\u2019ll write to Warrick about this. He might not be able to do anything about it considering he\u2019s in another province, but he\u2019s about the only one you can trust and maybe he knows something and can at least give you advice.\n\nYou write a letter to Warrick that night and hand it to a professional courier in Blossumdale the next day. Not having anything else to do, you return to your duties. Days pass into weeks and weeks pass into months. Just when you\u2019re starting to wonder if your letter got intercepted and someone having sinister plans for you, you get a letter back from Warrick.\n\nYou\u2019re anxious to see his reply and you find a quiet place to open it up and read it private. You\u2019re expecting a long letter, but instead you get a short one that\u2019s to the point.\n\nThings are already in motion to remedy the situation soon and your duty to the kingdom has been noted.\n\nWarrick\n\nYou can only guess that Captain Eckers will soon be gone with wording like that. You didn\u2019t expect anything to be done either, just advice. Warrick must have better connections than you thought.\n\nAnother week passes since you received Warrick\u2019s reply and Fort Green is visited by a general with his personal assistants, a couple of royals and a well-dressed gnome. The visit is unexpected by everyone, especially Captain Eckers since he\u2019d know first if anyone was scheduled to visit.\n\nCaptain Eckers and several others are taken into rooms and questioned separately. The rest of you are ordered to go about your business and to not interfere. Later you are called in as well. You find yourself face to face with one of the generals. General Benson. He\u2019s probably about the same age as Eckers, though obviously more successful.\n\n\u201cSergeant, I\u2019m going to make this quick. You are the one who wrote the letter to Captain Warrick are you not?\u201d General Benson asks.\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why did you write to Captain Warrick about your concerns? Why not write to Major Samuels? He is the superior officer in charge of this province.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure if I should sir. For all I knew he might\u2019ve had sympathies with Captain Eckers and if that had been the case, my situation would not have been a good one.\u201d\n\u201cHold on sergeant, are you telling me Major Samuels is also part of this?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t even know the Major sir, I was just being cautious on my part. I wrote to Warrick because\u2026well he\u2019s the only person I felt I could absolutely trust.\u201d\n\nThe general is silent for a moment while he looks you up and down.\n\n\u201cTell me, have you had any conflict while being here?\u201d\n\u201cConflict with the other soldiers? No sir, can\u2019t say that I have, I tend to just do my job and keep to myself as far as social matters are concerned.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your relationship with Captain Eckers?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a respectful one sir, I feel no malice towards him nor perceive any towards me.\u201d\n\u201cYet you felt the need to report him.\u201d\n\u201cWell sir, I thought it was something that might be needed to be brought to the attention of those in a higher position than me. Dissension in the ranks is no good sir. These sorts of things need to be taken care of before they spread. I know from direct experience, sir.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm, yes I suppose you would\u2026\u201d\n\nGeneral Benson continues to study you as if he\u2019s trying to read your mind, after a minute of this, he backs off and starts to pack up some papers on a nearby desk.\n\n\u201cI think we have everything we need to know. We weren\u2019t exactly sure about you for a long time, and quite frankly some of us still aren\u2019t. Your lack of trust among your fellow soldiers is concerning, but considering what we\u2019ve found here, possibly understandable. As of now, I\u2019m promoting you to captain and putting you in charge of Fort Green until further notice. You\u2019ll be receiving some new soldiers soon to replace the men that will be leaving here. And hopefully this reward for your dedication to the Kingdom alleviates some of your trust issues.\u201d\n\u201cIt will sir. It will. Thanks you sir.\u201d\n\u201cVery good, you\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou step out of the room feeling a sense of accomplishment. This is truly the first time since you pledged loyalty to the Felkan Kingdom that you feel appreciated. With this new command you actually feel like you\u2019re back to where you\u2019re supposed to be again, which is something you haven\u2019t felt since you were taken off of your command in Rask. Granted Fort Green is no Fort Destiny, but it\u2019s better than where you were.\n\nAs for Captain Eckers, he and several other soldiers are escorted out of the fort as the rest of you stand by and watch. On his way out Eckers glares at you, he doesn\u2019t say anything, but you can feel as if his stare is burning a hole in you. He knows someone said something, and he knows that someone was you. It\u2019s too bad it had to be this way, but what\u2019s done is done and it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nOver the next few months you begin running the fort a lot more efficiently, the soldiers aren\u2019t particularly thrilled about it since they\u2019ve gotten used to not doing as much under Captain Eckers, which is another good reason why he needed to leave. Instead of whining, he should\u2019ve been thinking up stuff to keep everyone\u2019s mind\u2019s occupied.\n\nAfter a few more months of extra training, you pick the soldier who has shown the most promise and pull them aside in your office for a talk.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Sergeant Dawn Young\u2026easy name to remember. You\u2019re one of the newer transfers here. Says that before you came here, you served on the Kilania Plains. Not exactly familiar with that area, but I hear it\u2019s infested with centaurs. Half man half horse or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir, they are little more than wild beast. They get drunk, breed, start fights and from what I can tell that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, bet they were a joy to fight. Well from your record it says you successfully lead several attacks on them. I\u2019m guessing they are no longer a problem anymore?\u201d\n\u201cWell they are less of a problem than they were. I was told to hold back, by my commanding officer at the time. I know if we had pressed against them though we could\u2019ve wiped them out completely though.\u201d She remark with a slightly annoyed tone.\n\nSounds like typical Felkan policy. You have to admit, Eckers did have a point about certain things. While you\u2019re not going to support possible rebellion like he did, you are going to change some things.\n\n\u201cOkay you sound like the kind of soldier I need. Consider yourself promoted to lieutenant and you\u2019re my new second.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026wow\u2026thank you sir!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t go thanking me just yet, you still have live to enjoy it. I want you to take two platoons of soldiers, march over to those hills a few miles away and I want you to wipe out ALL of the gnolls that you see.\u201d\n\u201cAll of them sir?\u201d\n\u201cAll of them. Their warriors, their citizens, their women, their children. If there are little baby gnolls sucking on marrowbones in their cribs, I want you to kill them too.\u201d\n\nYour orders are a little shocking to Dawn. She\u2019s probably never heard anyone commanding the murder of infants before let alone the total war doctrine you\u2019re following, even if it is against a bunch of barbaric monsters.\n\n\u201cLieutenant, am I going to have to find someone else to do this?\u201d you ask.\n\u201c\u2026Um no sir. I just\u2026well\u2026the other soldiers sir. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll follow such orders.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes they will. Because it\u2019s going to be YOUR job to make sure they follow them. Besides I\u2019ve noticed guns tend to take away a lot of the emotional impact of killing. Not even like you have to look someone in the eye and take away their life. You can sit back comfortably from a few feet away and pull the trigger. They\u2019ll be able to kill baby gnolls a lot easier than you think, and after this first time, it\u2019s only going to get easier. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine, I have faith that you\u2019re up to this task. I wouldn\u2019t have picked you if I didn\u2019t. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n\nLooking a little overwhelmed, Dawn nods and leaves your office.\n\nNow all you have to concern yourself about is whether your changes get you thrown out of the fort like Captain Eckers.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 45\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably attack at night sir.\u201d Dawn says to you.\n\u201cYeah, gnolls are predictable that way. Is Blossumdale under control?\n\u201cYes sir, we executed most of the rabble rousers, the rest have shut up complaining about food rationing and troops permanently stationed in the town now sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Ooooooh I\u2019m gonna hear it for that one.\u201d You groan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why sir, you were merely keeping order and doing what needed to be done to help protect the kingdom.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but the top brass won\u2019t see it that way. There won\u2019t be any way to keep this one quiet. News is going to travel eventually, despite the fact that I\u2019m already keeping a lot of stuff out of the reports as it is. Hell, I\u2019ve been getting blamed for stirring up a so called hornet\u2019s nest with the gnolls since this war began.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true sir, if you hadn\u2019t sent me into those hills all those years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have found out that they\u2019d been planning a mass invasion for quite some time.\u201d\n\u201cThat may be the case, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they need to blame me for whatever reason.\u201d\n\u201cSir if they\u2019re so displeased with you, why have they not just replaced you?\u201d\n\u201cGood question. I imagine it\u2019s because the gnolls are a very real threat and that I am actually doing a good job at holding back the gnolls with what little resources I do have. Everyone is still so worried about the Eternal Dominion possibly invading that they\u2019re shoving all the troops along that border. Oh well, I guess I should be grateful they finally sent us some new cannons, though it took three years to get them. Okay lieutenant, that will be all, I suggest you prepare everyone because I get the feeling the gnolls\u2019 attack tonight is going to be a big one.\u201d\n\nDawn nods and leaves your office. She\u2019s a good second; you couldn\u2019t have picked a better choice. You\u2019re actually proud of how all your soldiers have stepped up over the past few years. All they needed was a little more discipline and something to keep them focused like a relentless army of hyena men eager to rip them apart and feast on their bodies.\n\nDespite the fact that the top brass nearly hates you and you\u2019re on the eve of what is probably going to be a vicious battle. You feel good, like the best you\u2019ve felt in years. You have a command, you have soldiers that are utterly dedicated and you have a ruthless enemy to fight. The excitement of battle is near and you can\u2019t wait to bask in the violence of it. This is what you were BORN for.\n\nAs darkness falls, you stand on top of the battlements and see the gnolls arrive right on time. They might be fierce warriors, but their ongoing crap strategy of throwing as many troops at you as possible isn\u2019t working for them. You think orcs might\u2019ve even been smarter than that, well at least Gruz would\u2019ve been. There are an awful lot of them though this time, it appears that you were right, tonight\u2019s battle is going to be a big one.\n\nAs the horde gets closer, you also see several flying creatures in the distance. Wyverns. The bastards actually managed to tame wyverns. Looks like they\u2019re a little brighter than you initially gave them credit for. You tell the cannon crews to fire upon the wyverns as soon as they get in range, all musket men on top of the fort as well.\n\nYou stare down at the temporary wall you\u2019ve built around the fort where some of your other troops are guarding and hope it\u2019ll hold up well. They\u2019ll eventually break it down, but hopefully not before heavy losses. You also hope the fortifications at Blossumdale will hold out. You couldn\u2019t spare as many troops there, but you\u2019re confident that Dawn will be able to handle the situation if the gnolls split up their attack.\n\nThe battle starts off with the gnolls attempting a rain of arrows technique, fortunately you prepared for that by having everyone equipped with shields nearby. The Felkans as a general rule don\u2019t use them too much anymore due to their reliance on firearms, but your re-emphasis on close combat training made your request for a shipment of shields quite logical.\n\nThe wyverns then dive in from above while the horde concentrates on below. A couple of your new cannons prove their worth by landing a nice cannon ball into the side of one their heads, even better when it crashes into the gnoll horde. Another cannon ball tears a hole in the wing of another causing it and it\u2019s rider to attempt a crash landing in the distance.\n\nOut of the remaining three wyverns, one veers away and heads to Blossumdale, while the other two focus on the fort. You order all your men to fire upon one of them which riddles it with gunshot wounds. Not enough to kill it however as lands on the fort and manages crush and bite some of the cannon crews. It\u2019s rider fires a bow taking out a musket man next to you, and that\u2019s when you make a running leap forward to stab the wyvern right in the neck. Blood gushes out and the beast flails about, causing the rider to fall off and over the fort walls to the ground below.\n\nYou dodge the beast\u2019s attempt at biting you in two and make a long slash cut through one of it\u2019s wing so it can\u2019t fly away. It tries to smash you with it\u2019s tail, but you roll out of the way and finally land a killing blow by jumping on its back and running your sword through the top of it\u2019s head.\n\nThe other wyvern has been faring better against the remaining men on the fort roof, though it\u2019s rider lies dead with a gunshot wound to his face. Since the beast is intent on hovering above rather than actually landing you have to make another running jump to grab on to one of its feet. The creature attempts to shake you off, but you manage to hang on long enough to stab upward several times into it\u2019s soft underbelly. The creature twists and roars in pain, this time managing to cause you to fall to the fort roof, you are then covered in gouts of wyvern blood and chunks of entrails. You order your remaining men to fire upon it as it desperately tries to fly away. The musket balls do their job and the beast falls to the war zone bellow, unfortunately crashing into one of the temporary walls you put up. Granted the dead beast\u2019s bulk is now acting a small block now, but the gnoll horde has a slightly easier access than it did before.\n\nYou tell your men to start firing upon the horde, which is starting to surround the entire fort, while you rush down to the ground floor to help out the rest of your troops. You also notice that some of the horde is indeed breaking off into a separate group and moving past the fort towards Blossumdale.\n\nLadders go up to scale the walls, and axes attempt to bring them down completely. Some of the gnolls have already gotten in. Won\u2019t be long before they completely overrun this first layer of defense. After hacking down several of them, you tell all your men to fall back to the front gates and inside the fort. You have everyone barricade the doors as best you can while telling several soldiers on top to start dropping firebombs on the gnolls from the roof.\n\nSeveral explosions deafen the ears of all involved in this battle, smokes completely envelopes the fort and gnoll body parts are covering the battlefield. After briefly falling back, the gnolls continue their attack and try to scale the fort walls with ladders and break down the front gates with a battering ram.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of firebombs and we\u2019re running low on gunpowder sir!\u201d one of your men says.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve greatly decreased their numbers now, we can take the rest of them hand to hand, hell just start dropping the rest of the cannon balls on their heads when they try to come up!\u201d\n\nThe gnolls fail at scaling the walls, but their size and strength makes their attempts at breaking down the front gate a lot more successful. Dozens of them come pouring in and you\u2019re the first one to charge into battle. You aren\u2019t even paying much attention to the rest of your troops at this point, you\u2019re goal is to just kill as many as these gnolls as possible. You were covered in blood already, now you\u2019ve just replaced one coat of blood for another.\n\nEventually after lopping off the heads of several of these hyenas you see one their number arrive standing much larger than the rest. It\u2019s the leader. The biggest one is ALWAYS the leader with these types.\n\nAfter making that annoying laughing growl sound that they love to make the gnoll leader sees you and swings his huge morning star into the floor near your feet. When he lifts it up to strike again you attempt to close the gap and you duck just in time for it to miss your head. You bring the gnoll leader down with a chop to his shins. Like a great tree he falls to his knees and you chop his head off like you\u2019ve done with so many of his other kin.\n\nOne of the gnolls seeing their leader dead, and already taken considerable losses, the gnoll shouts something in his strange language and they begin to retreat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won!\u201d a soldier shouts.\n\u201cNo, not yet, we\u2019ve still got gnolls at Blossumdale, not to mention not all of these fuckers are running away yet.\u201d\n\nWhile you are pretty certain the battle here is indeed finishing up, you aren\u2019t sure what the situation is at Blossumdale. Besides Blossumdale, part of you is specifically concerned about Dawn, you know you really shouldn\u2019t be as she\u2019s a very capable soldier, but the concern is still there.\n\nThere is still mopping up to do around the fort, but you really should send reinforcements to Blossumdale, the question is whether or not you should lead them personally.", "action_results": [{"action": "Lead the reinforcements personally", "result": "The situation at Blossumdale needs to be looked after directly, the fort will be fine now. Besides saving the town, your concern for Dawn is great and you want to make sure she\u2019s okay. After dispatching the remaining gnolls in the fort, you order a platoon to accompany you to Blossumdale while the rest of the soldiers reinforce the fort. You rush as quickly as you can to Blossumdale.\n\nCall it bad luck, rash behavior, or the fate of the battle, but unfortunately you never make it. On your way to Blossumdale, gnolls that retreated from the fort are still very much lurking about on the fringes of the area. A group of them notices you, but you\u2019re in such a hurry you don\u2019t notice them in time.\n\nSeveral arrows fly out from their hiding spot and bring down several of your men. You try to look for somewhere to hide and take cover, but you\u2019re completely out in the open. A couple more arrows fly and they hit their mark, and one that flies into your neck is the last one you feel.\n\nAs you lay dying, you can only hope that Dawn is alive and well, because you aren\u2019t due to your lapse in judgment.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Stay behind and secure the fort", "result": "You need to stay here and oversee the purging of this fort, and the surrounding area. You can\u2019t start running off half assed because you\u2019re a little worried about one soldier even if she is one of the best ones you\u2019ve had under your command. (Not including your fellow Eternals of course)\n\nAfter slaying all the gnolls still in the fort, you regroup your soldiers and tell one of the sergeants to head over the Blossumdale with a couple platoons and help in whatever way they can. You tell the rest of your soldiers to start rebuilding the walls, clear out the dead bodies and to help you do a sweep of the area.\n\nYour sweep of the area is a tedious, but vital one. A lot of the gnolls retreated to various areas just enough to be out of sight, but were obviously still attempting to regroup again. Good thing you stayed behind to mop up all these little clusters so they didn\u2019t form a big one again. By the time you\u2019re satisfied with your results, the sun is coming up and you return to the fort more than a little tired.\n\nWhen you get back, you\u2019re happy to see Dawn there.\n\n\u201cSir, Blossumdale still stands sir, the rest of the soldiers are securing it and the area.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it, and glad to see you made it out in one peace. Was the fighting heavy?\u201d\n\u201cIt was, but from the looks of it, the fighting was worse here. The only problem we had is with a wyvern.\u201d\n\u201cLucky you only had one. We had four of them and I had to kill two of them myself.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one more than me then, sir.\u201d\n\nYou smile at her remark and after a brief discussion on what the next course of action will be, you get some rest.\n\nOver the next few months the gnoll attacks die down, but they don\u2019t stop completely. Most of your activities involve going further into the wilderness and taking out whatever villages or camps they have. In the meantime your superiors are telling you to stop your actions as the war has been won and now you\u2019re just using up valuable manpower and resources. You really aren\u2019t though; you\u2019ve been doing just fine with the limited supplies that they see fit to give you. Somehow this situation seems very familiar\u2026\n\nWhile your superiors do a lot of complaining, nothing actually happens to you. It would seem they\u2019re bitching at you just for the sake of bitching. The gnolls might not actually be able to invade properly anymore, but if you let them regroup again, they\u2019ll try it. Your goal is to purge them all, or at the very least drive them away so they don\u2019t try it ever again.\n\nYear 50\n\n\u201cThis is bullshit sir, executing those protestors was the right thing to do!\u201d\n\u201cCalm down lieutenant.\u201d You say to Dawn.\n\u201cNo sir, this isn\u2019t right! They can\u2019t punish you just for doing your fucking job!\u201d\n\u201cOkay lieutenant I said calm down! Now listen, I need you on your best behavior, because they\u2019re going to question all of us. I saw this happen to my predecessor. (sigh) Who knows maybe I did go too far, I mean I haven\u2019t exactly been following Felkan policies, I\u2019ve been sort of doing my own thing out here for the past ten years.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but your actions are protecting the kingdom! How can that be wrong?\u201d\n\nYou look at Dawn and see that she\u2019s changed quite a bit since she stood here in this office several years ago hesitant to kill baby gnolls. She\u2019s practically like an Empire soldier now. Everyone in this fort is and that\u2019s what is no doubt getting you into trouble. Still, they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for what you just ordered them to do.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe I was protecting the kingdom, but I still wasn\u2019t following the laws. And I certainly broke enough of them. Just don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure nobody here gets blamed. I mean you were all just following orders.\u201d\n\u201cThank you sir, but I knew exactly what I was doing and if they put you against the wall in front of a firing squad for treason, then I want to be standing right next to you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026that\u2019s a very\u2026enthusiastic sentiment, but I don\u2019t think that will be necessary. I mean maybe this won\u2019t even be all that bad, they did at least warn me that they were coming. They didn\u2019t even do that with Eckers. Look lieutenant\u2026Dawn, whatever happens don\u2019t go doing something foolish like trying to save me or sacrificing yourself or something. Just continue to serve the kingdom and try to follow the laws the best you can, okay?\u201d\n\nDawn is visible upset by all this. She turns her head for a moment while sniffling, then turns back to you and agrees. She then excuses herself to get ready for this investigation. Wasn\u2019t really until this moment that you see that you\u2019ve have a very deep effect on her. You didn\u2019t expect to, as you treated her like any one else under your command, well maybe you did compliment her a little bit more, but that\u2019s only because she did more.\n\nEventually the investigation group gets arrives. To your surprise it consists of only two people, General Benson, and that gnome you saw before during Captain Ecker\u2019s investigation, you certainly hope this turns out a lot better.\n\nAll your troops stand at attention and you greet the general. After a brief exchange the well dress gnome parts company with the general who approaches you and just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cI knew we made a bad decision.\u201d He says and motions you to your office.\n\nYou sit down and the general sits down and he begins his questions right away.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get right to it shall we? You are aware that you\u2019re serving the Felkan Kingdom aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You do? Well then, is there any particular reason why you\u2019re treating this area as if you still serving your long dead Empire?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow you sir.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid with me, I\u2019ve read the reports and followed all your actions for the past ten years! You\u2019ve trained these soldiers to the point that they\u2019re fanatically loyal and dedicated, you started a war with the gnolls and didn\u2019t stop hostilities until you completely eliminated their species, during which time you executed several Felkan citizens in Blossumdale and now you\u2019ve done it again! Tell me, is war, murder and genocide all they taught you in the Empire?\u201d\n\u201cBasically.\u201d\n\u201cYou might not want to be so flip with me, Eternal, your ass is just a step away from the gallows yourself.\u201d\n\u201cSir, with all due respect if I was such a problem for the past ten years, why not get rid of me before now?\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, believe me, if I\u2019d had any say in the matter you would\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\u201cSir, everything I\u2019ve done has been for the good of the Felkan Kingdom. I mean loyal and dedicated soldiers, since when is that a bad thing? Soldiers are supposed to follow orders of their superiors and government. That\u2019s sort of their whole purpose.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather ironic coming from you who seems to blatantly ignores orders like not starting wars.\u201d\n\u201cSir, the gnolls were an ongoing problem even if they weren\u2019t planning an invasion. Isn\u2019t it better that they\u2019re all dead so that Felkan citizens don\u2019t have to worry about getting robbed and killed on the roads? Blossomdale probably wouldn\u2019t be standing if we hadn\u2019t stopped them.\u201d\n\u201cDo you really want to bring up Blossumdale captain?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell not? You\u2019re bringing everything else up.\u201d You say starting to get angry.\n\u201cWatch your tone, and if you insist\u2026I already know your half assed excuse for executing citizens during the war with the gnolls, but please explain to me why you did it again this time, just so I can try to understand your fucked Eternal logic.\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s rather simple, some of the citizens were protesting the new tax that the king imposed. They were in front of the town hall screaming at their mayor as if he was directly to blame. We stepped in to calm them down, they started getting more violent and began throwing rocks. We told them to stop, they didn\u2019t, so we opened fire on them. After rounding up the main rabble rousers who didn\u2019t get shot the first time, we executed them properly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it? That\u2019s your excuse for gunning down several citizens?\u201d\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t done , what we told them not to do, they\u2019d still be alive right now, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there it is again, they didn\u2019t do what you told them to do, so they got killed, but when it comes to you, you apparently do whatever the hell you want.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true sir I was trying to stop a potential rebellion, you can ask the mayor and any of my soldiers about the situation and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking them, I\u2019m asking you! You wantonly executing protestors like that is more likely to cause a damn rebellion not stop one! Or\u2026 maybe that\u2019s what you really want Eternal? I mean that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t it? You train the troops to be utterly loyal, not to the Kingdom but to YOU. You\u2019re starting wars, you\u2019re executing Felkans which is going to cause more harm than good. Maybe this is your way of getting revenge on us? Perhaps you\u2019re trying to start your own little Empire with you as the emperor this time?\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t believe these accusations. Here you\u2019ve been doing what you can for the Felkan Kingdom by fighting off hostiles and putting down dissidents and you\u2019re the one getting accused of treason. You just rub your hands over your face trying hard not to chuckle too much at the dark humor in all this. General Benson just stares at you disapprovingly as he usually does, but remains silent. It is at this point the well-dressed gnome walks in and nods at the general, he lights up some pipeweed and stands in the corner observing.\n\nIt\u2019s at that moment you think back to Captain Ecker\u2019s accusations on the gnomes. Maybe he was right after all. Hardly matters at this point, because as far you\u2019re concerned everyone in charge here has been an asshole.\n\n\u201cSir, I chopped up a shitload of gnolls and executed dissidents in the service of this fucking kingdom and the whole time I\u2019ve done it all I\u2019ve gotten is bitching and general ungratefulness, yet I haven\u2019t complained. I didn\u2019t even complain when you fuckers never sent me supplies on time to help fight the gnoll invasion. I execute some worthless fucking peasants stirring up shit, and I\u2019m the fucking bad guy some how. Sir, I don\u2019t need to re-create the Empire, because as fucked up as the government policies are here, I THOUGHT I WAS STILL SERVING THE FUCKING THING!\u201d you shout.\n\nYou slump back in your chair still fuming after your outburst, and that\u2019s when the gnome speaks up in between puffs of his pipe.\n\n\u201cSo, Eternal did you want to leave?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you, did you want to leave? If you can\u2019t find a place here, then perhaps it would be better if you left. In gratitude of all your service to the kingdom, this is a one time offer for you to leave free and clear. There will be no repercussions except that you can never return here.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave", "result": "You\u2019ve tried to fit in here, but maybe it just isn\u2019t meant to be. The Felkan Kingdom hasn\u2019t given you the sense of purpose that you wanted except during the time you were fighting the gnolls and that\u2019s only because you created an environment that you felt comfortable in. This place operates in such a way that is at odds with how you do things and this \u201cgenerous\u201d offer that the gnome has given you is probably the best you\u2019re going to get, if you insist on staying.\n\nWhen you tell the gnome you\u2019re going to leave, General Benson is obviously pleased, though the gnome doesn\u2019t gloat. He simply nods and tells you that perhaps this is for the best. He assures you that nobody will be punished for any of the actions taken place her and that Lieutenant Young will take command of the fort. He also says he hopes you can find somewhere you belong.\n\nYou pack up your stuff and attempt to make a silent exit, but that\u2019s doomed to failure. Most of your soldiers want you to stay and even want to join you, but you tell them all that the Felkan Kingdom needs them and that there duty is here. Dawn is the most upset, but she manages to keep it together\n\nAs you put Fort Green and the Felkan Kingdom further behind you, you start to wonder what you\u2019re going to do now.

From what you\u2019ve heard Edgar\u2019s been getting more organized, he\u2019s even managed to conquer some of the old territories that the Empire lost. Perhaps he could use your help and maybe you could find your place there.\n\nAnother part of you wonders if you shouldn\u2019t just leave this whole region.

You travel through the southern portion of the Arat province and stop at a small village where you ask the local innkeeper where the nearest Eternal stronghold is. He tells you there\u2019s a new fort several miles away where there are some Eternals stationed, he also mentions that you shouldn\u2019t go messing around with them as they don\u2019t like anyone who isn\u2019t an Eternal to be wandering near there without reason.\n\n\u201cWell guess they\u2019ll like me then.\u201d You say and leave.\n\nWhen you get to the fort you are predictably stopped and given the hard looks. You\u2019re not intimidated in the least and explain who you are. They seem a little skeptical at first, obviously they\u2019ve heard of you, but since they never served directly under you, they aren\u2019t sure what you look like. One of them tells you to wait, while one of their fellows goes to ask someone inside.\n\nYou stand around waiting, while the remaining guards continue to give you dirty looks.

Watch your head.\u201d\n\nThis strange remark causes you to instinctively look up just in time to see someone pointing a musket at you from the top of the fort. Then you hear a loud blast and the top of your head is blown off in an explosion of skull and gray matter. You continue to stand and stare up for a moment and with what\u2019s left of your brain you realize the bastard who just shot you was one those new eternals present when you killed private Felding.\n\nYour body then collapses in a heap, while the rest of the new eternals congratulate their captain on his shot.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Travel to a distant land", "result": "You don\u2019t feel as if the Eternal Dominion is really the place for you.

Leaving these lands completely and finding your place elsewhere. It\u2019s a little daunting as you\u2019re wading into unknown waters as it were, but after all the things you\u2019ve faced in your life you\u2019re ready for the next challenge.\n\nYou travel further west putting the Felkan Kingdom far behind you. Over the course of the next three days you live off the land and basically just observe your surroundings.

No! What I am going to do is send you back home. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been AWOL long enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back home sir, I resigned my position shortly after you left.\u201d\n\u201cYou what? Dawn, why did you do that? You had a command position!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want it sir, I don\u2019t want to serve the Felkan Kingdom, I want to be with you.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) See this is the reason why I hoped you weren\u2019t following me.\u201d\n\u201cSir, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop calling me sir! I\u2019m not your commanding officer anymore! Look\u2026I think I know why you\u2019re following me and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\nDawn doesn\u2019t immediately comment and the both of you are silent for a moment, as the pair of you knows you\u2019re referring to feelings she has for you go beyond simple respect. And while you\u2019ve been pretty closely guarded about the situation as well, it would be a lie to say you don\u2019t feel something for her as well.\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 and why is that exactly?\u201d she slowly asks.\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where the hell I\u2019m going or know what the hell I\u2019m going to do with myself now. All of what I was taught to believe in, is gone and there is no getting that back. I\u2019m literally lost and I doubt if I\u2019ll ever settle down.\u201d\n\u201cWell if I come with you, perhaps you\u2019ll be a little less lost with another set of eyes helping you.\u201d\n\u201cDawn. You have a country. A home. A life. You even have a command if you get back there quick enough. You have something to fight for, do you really want to give that up?\u201d\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t have you, then yes. Maybe because of your upbringing, you hold such things in very high regard. Most people don\u2019t work that way, you know.\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Yes I know, but what I\u2019m saying is coming with me is unlikely to result in us settling down and living out our lives in some sort of wedded bliss with a house and kids.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who says I want that? I will be happy just as long as I\u2019m by your side. If that means forever wandering, then I\u2019ll be right there wandering next to you. My life before I met you, wasn\u2019t a great one as you probably know and I only joined the military as an escape from poverty. You believed in me enough to give me my very first command. You taught me that I was capable of more when I sometimes wasn\u2019t even sure myself. After all you\u2019ve done for me it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to leave you when you\u2019re feeling something similar now.\u201d\n\nEven you can\u2019t help but be touched by that remark and you aren\u2019t exactly sure of how to respond. When Dawn approaches closer to you, and the pair of you look into each other\u2019s eyes, the response is certain and the pair of you kiss, finally taking those first steps towards your love for each other.\n\nThe next morning after your passionate embrace, you and Dawn begin your journey together and leave the known region far behind. In the years that follow the pair of you wander, seeing new sights and getting into adventures. Several times you genuinely attempt to find a place where you feel comfortable, but it just never happens. While the pair of you never do settle down, your love continues to last.\n\nWhat ultimately happens to the both of you is lost to time.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Continue to stay", "result": "As tempting as it might be to leave, you did that once before and it hasn\u2019t turned out that great. Besides where would you go now? The only place that you know of that has any resemblance of civilization is the Eternal Dominion, and you\u2019re fairly certain you wouldn\u2019t be welcomed. Right now you\u2019re sort of wishing that you\u2019d stuck around during the last days of the Empire instead of leaving. Perhaps you could\u2019ve made more of a difference than you thought, or maybe you could\u2019ve fit in better among the ranks of the Eternal Dominion. The general was probably correct on a few points. You have tried to make this place more \u201cEmpire like\u201d, but it\u2019s all you know. You can only change so much. You wonder how Warrick managed to adapt as well as he did in a much shorter period of time.\n\nThe only other option is leaving this land far behind and living as a directionless wanderer hoping that you find something. You can\u2019t do that either. You\u2019ve made your choice and you have to stick by it now for good or ill.\n\n\u201cI want to stay. I pledged myself to this Kingdom and I meant it. So whatever punishment you feel is necessary, I\u2019ll accept, but I just ask that you don\u2019t punish anyone under my command. They\u2019re good soldiers and only did what they were told to do.\u201d\n\nThe gnome asks the general to step outside and for you to stay put. You do so and wait in your office mostly staring at the various objects in it. Eventually the gnome returns, he pulls up a chair and sits across from you.\n\n\u201cFirst things first, you\u2019re not going to be punished for and anything and your actions have been appreciated. Perhaps not by everyone in the kingdom, but in certain circles they are. Personally, I don\u2019t think you were intentionally trying to carve out your own piece of land, I truly believe you were doing what was best for the Felkan Kingdom. However, some are still concerned with your Empire past. I know you can\u2019t help what you were and in some cases still are, but there is always a slight fear there. Especially you being one those Eternals and all.\u201d\n\u201cWarrick\u2019s an Eternal, he directly fought against the Felkan Kingdom and he seems be accepted.\u201d You point out.\n\u201cWarrick, is a special case\u2026(sigh) I probably shouldn\u2019t even be telling you this, but considering the cluster fuck this situation is becoming, I\u2019m going to be just as honest as you have with me. Warrick didn\u2019t voluntarily join the kingdom, he was made that way.\u201d\n\u201cMade? What do you mean? Mind control? Torture?\u201d you say in shock at this revelation.\n\u201cI doubt if any torture would cause anyone to switch their allegiances, at least not permanently and we don\u2019t engage in any sort of magic mumbo jumbo around here. No, Warrick was a dedicated foe against the Felkan Kingdom. We tried to get him and his partner for a long time, but never could catch them. Things got even worse when his partner was replaced by that Edgar fellow. By the gods, Edgar was a menace on the battlefield\u2026anyway back to Warrick. Warrick as you probably know was mainly engaged in sabotage and similar tactics. Well, his luck just ran out one day ironically towards the last days of the war. Had a small explosive hit the side of his face by one of the many traps set up.\u201d\n\u201cBut he lived.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but he wouldn\u2019t have if our medics hadn\u2019t been nearby at the time. When he was found he was bleeding from his eye socket and didn\u2019t even know where he was or who he was. Soldiers probably would\u2019ve probably killed him, but like I said, he was luckily found by a couple of gnome medics, they decided to\u2026re-align him instead. Memories are an unpredictable thing, so attempting to practically reconstruct his entire past would\u2019ve been a fool\u2019s errand, instead they just slowly over time convinced him that he had willingly joined the Felkan Kingdom due to his disillusionment of the Empire as he healed up. It worked a lot better than we thought, I can only guess that Warrick may have had some genuine disillusionment with the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t that still risky? Couldn\u2019t he still remember what really happened one day?\u201d\n\u201cDoubt it, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware from talking with him, his memory when discussing anything before his injury is patchy. In any case we also keep an eye on him\u2026you seem to be taking this well, I would\u2019ve thought you might\u2019ve been angry and trying to kill me by now.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe at one time I would\u2019ve been furious, perhaps a small part of me is, but I\u2019m more baffled by the idea that you\u2019d go through the trouble that you as opposed to the more efficient task of killing him.\u201d\n\u201cAhh yes, well that is one of the failings of my race I believe. A lot of us are non-violent at heart; ironic considering that we also develop some of the most destructive weapons in the known world. Peace through superior firepower I suppose.\u201d\n\nWith the way the gnome is speaking, he\u2019s practically telling you how things are really run in the Felkan Kingdom. His very presence is proof of it.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true? The gnomes do really run the kingdom?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHeh, I wish that was the case, certainly we have a lot of influence, but nothing is ever certain. There are always complications.\u201d\n\u201cSo why are you telling me all this? Aren\u2019t you worried that I\u2019ll kill you and try to free Warrick from your brainwashing techniques or try to stir up anti-gnome rhetoric like Eckers or others?\u201d\n\u201cYou could certainly try, but I doubt if you\u2019d be very successful. The only thing you might be able to do is easily kill me and start a small rebellion with your company of Empire-like troops. You\u2019d probably do a lot of damage, but you wouldn\u2019t topple the kingdom. Besides what I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m telling you for a reason.\u201d\n\nThe gnome stops smoking completely and leans forward as best he can with as short as he is.\n\n\u201cThere are changes coming Eternal, necessary changes to keep the Kingdom from falling and quite frankly I believe we NEED someone like you. The conspiracy theory that we gnomes run everything is only half true. The fact is, we\u2019re suffering from as much infighting as any other race does. Tell me Eternal, were you aware that a long time ago the gnomes used to live in the Empire as slaves? Hell we were responsible for most of the technological advancements that the Empire even had, like the aqueducts and such. Good thing we never discovered gunpowder during that time, we\u2019d probably still be living under Empire boots.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did study Empire history when I was little, it was required. Don\u2019t remember anything specific being said about your people though, just that you were slaves.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, figures that they would play down our achievements. Truth is, while we were slaves we had comfortable positions. We were treated well and kept safe. Wasn\u2019t until we saw what the Empire did to our Halfling cousins that we made the decision to make a mass exodus. They were slaves too, but not treated as well, so naturally they wanted equal rights like any normal citizen. When they didn\u2019t get that, they pushed harder. When the Empire pushed back, it wasn\u2019t a pretty.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the Halfling uprising. I read about that.\u201d\n\u201cUprising? It was more like a slaughter. We tried to warn them against such actions, but they were too proud even though they had no chance. The Empire as you know wiped them all out. I believe it was the first time we saw the Empire practice genocide on such a scale. We couldn\u2019t fight the Empire, but we couldn\u2019t stay for fear of our own lives. After all what would\u2019ve happened if the Empire decided that we were also getting too uppity one day? When we eventually arrived to these lands the Felkans didn\u2019t even have a kingdom yet, but when it started looking like they would get organized, we made the decision to ingrain ourselves into helping shape it. We would not become slave again, but living in a powerful nation could protect us if the Empire ever started expanding this way, and given the past few decades I\u2019d say we were right.\u201d\n\nA fascinating little part of history you have to admit, but you still aren\u2019t sure what this all has to do with you.\n\n\u201cSo, exactly how do I fit in here?\u201d\n\u201cThe Empire might be gone, but you and specifically the Eternal Dominion are its successors. And from what I can tell the ED looks like its every bit as ruthless as the Empire, perhaps even more so. Some of us are starting to believe the Felkan policies on aggression need to be altered. Due to our past with seeing first hand of what happened to the Halflings, our people are generally disgusted by the thought of slavery or total annihilation of any race. Hence all the policies against engaging in wars of conquest and aggression and the more relaxed political views\u2026well at least until you came along.\u201d\n\u201cWell I know why I act the way I do, but there were others who obviously don\u2019t agree with the policies long before I showed up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s true too. Mostly humans though, I suppose humans just have a natural tendency towards conquest. That\u2019s why my circle believes we need to let go of our past a bit and start changing before the grumblings get worse. Perhaps a little nationalism is what the Felkan Kingdom needs to direct the hatred towards external threats rather than crumbling from within. And as bad as I feel saying this, what you did with the gnolls was very necessary.\u201d\n\u201cWell if it eases your conscience I probably didn\u2019t strictly wipe out ALL the gnolls, I\u2019m sure quite a few of them just ran far away.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter, they\u2019re gone and no longer a threat. The fact is we\u2019re probably going to need more like you when we eventually go up against the ED, if only because of your experience, let alone your mindset. You\u2019re going to be transferred; in fact everyone here is going to be transferred to Fort Soot. You\u2019re going to be needed on the frontlines.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that where Warrick is stationed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019ve got another task for him, his sabotage and stealth skills can be used to help us as opposed to all those years he was working against us. Now there\u2019s some other stuff that needs to be done as well, but you really don\u2019t need to worry about it. All I need you to do is to prepare everyone along the Arat border for a possible invasion. The ED is getting more organized everyday and we can\u2019t afford to be caught off guard. You said you pledged yourself to defend this kingdom\u2026I trust even after all of what you\u2019ve learned here, that pledge is still true?\u201d\n\u201cI gave my word and you\u2019ve revealed much about the real way things work around here. That\u2019s probably more than the Empire ever did. The Felkan Kingdom has my loyalty, but I must be allowed to do things my way when it comes to battle and war.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026will be arranged. As I\u2019ve said, other things need to be taken care of, but rest assured you will have support, just one thing, could you stop killing protesting peasants? I understand that\u2019s a hold over from your Empire training, but that\u2019s something you\u2019re really going to have to stop doing.\u201d\n\u201cI will. My apologies.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, just no more of it in the future unless you\u2019re specifically given the order to do so. Anyway probably won\u2019t be a problem, not many villages along the Arat borders anymore since the last war. Okay, I believe that\u2019s it, oh by the way, my name is Klemto Zookwinkle and I\u2019ll most likely be in touch in the future.\u201d\n\nThe gnome shakes your hand, straightens his hat and leaves the office, leaving you to take in all of the new information thrust upon you. Oddly the only thing you can immediately think is:\n\n\u201cKlemto Zookwinkle? That\u2019s silly fucking name!\u201d you laugh.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 55\n\nAnother clear night and you look out across the Arat border from the fort roof knowing that the ED could invade soon\u2026though you\u2019ve been waiting for about five years now. If anything you\u2019d wish that they\u2019d hurry up and do it or as you\u2019ve often suggested to Klemto, that you strike at the ED first.\n\nHe of course claims he\u2019s still trying to sway the royals to do such a thing, most importantly the king. Seems the gnomes are still playing tug of war with their puppet strings. You suggested that a few assassinations would do the trick, but Klemto was a little upset at you for that suggestion.\n\nIn any case Klemto better hurry up and get this war started, because more anti-gnome groups are starting to pop up and it\u2019s getting harder to keep them quiet, especially since they aren\u2019t wrong about their accusations.\n\nAs for you, you\u2019re a major now and you\u2019re not only in charge of Fort Soot, but the entire Gan province as far as military is concerned. You\u2019ve been busying yourself with having the soldiers keep to their patrols and training. Instilling the same routines that you did at Fort Green. Your results have been more or less just as successful. Dawn is still your second, though she\u2019s a captain now and she\u2019s more of a concern to you than any potential war right now.\n\nYou really should\u2019ve transferred her to another fort, as she\u2019s certainly competent enough to run one and even during the gnoll war you suspected that she had feelings for you that were more than just a professional respect. The problem is, you had feelings for her too and by the time both of you admitted them to each other it unleashed itself in a night of passion. This wasn\u2019t like what happened between you and Alison at Fort Destiny though, you didn\u2019t separate love and sex from each other and now you\u2019re too attached to Dawn to have her transferred.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an excessive problem in day-to-day operations, but to you it\u2019s a definite weakness on your part. You don\u2019t even know how the hell you can even feel love as you\u2019ve never really experienced it before, but then you remember Brenda and Roldan and they did. They even worked together and married. Perhaps you\u2019re over thinking it.\n\nSpeaking of Brenda, you\u2019ve finally got information on what she\u2019s been up to thanks to Warrick\u2019s intelligence gathering missions. She\u2019s apparently still in charge of all of the Nalin province and the only other Eternal that has equal rank to Edgar. She joined the Eternal Dominion years ago when Edgar came to her in Nalin, but Warrick has told you that she isn\u2019t happy with the situation. Warrick has said that she is willing to give out Edgar\u2019s plans and troops movements. So far they\u2019ve been updating their equipment and consolidating their territory still. She claims that Edgar has his sights on either re-conquering Rask or invading the Felkan Kingdom, but nothing is certain yet. The big thing is Edgar has actually managed to completely unite the new eternals under a doctrine that only they are fit to rule and new generations of eternals are still being trained. You have to say, you\u2019re a little impressed by his accomplishments.\n\nEdgar a despot, Warrick a brainwashed spy, Brenda a traitorous informant and you in charge of an army that was once an enemy. If someone told you when you were fresh out of Gruz\u2019s training school that this is how the four of you would end up, you never would\u2019ve believed it.\n\n\u201cRoldan, Gerald\u2026Kane, I can only imagine what you\u2019re thinking as you watch us all from wherever you are.\u201d You say out loud, briefly thinking about the good old days when things were simpler.\n\nYou stop with the nostalgia to return to your room to get some rest, where you find Dawn sleeping. You try not to wake her, but you\u2019re doomed to failure. She moves over to cuddle next to you.\n\n\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d You tell her.\n\u201cHey, if you\u2019re here, who\u2019s in charge of the fort?\u201d she groggily asks.\n\u201cLieutenant Baker.\u201d\n\u201cHim? Ugh, I better go on duty\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey come back to bed. He\u2019s capable of handling it, besides, it\u2019s not like anything is going on.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so. I just feel more comfortable with you or me in charge.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well you\u2019ve been working too hard anyway. You probably need more rest than anyone, so go back to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMmmm, I\u2019m up now, but if you\u2019d like me to stay in bed, we could do something else\u2026\u201d Dawn says rubbing your chest and kissing the side of your face.\n\nYeah, you\u2019ve been over thinking the possible downsides of this relationship too much lately. You take Dawn up on her offer and have fun living for the moment rather than pondering the past or concerning yourself about future.\n\nThe next morning you return to your duties as usual. For most of the day it looks like it\u2019s going to be another routine one, and that\u2019s when you get an unexpected visit from Klemto. When he arrives in your office, he has a slight frown in his face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m suspecting bad news.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s fifty fifty I suppose. Warrick has just given me news that Edgar is planning on attacking the Rask frontier. Not exactly sure how long it\u2019ll take him, before he sets his sights on us again though. There isn\u2019t really a government system in place there, it\u2019s more of a collection of isolated towns relying on mercs to keep monsters at bay from what I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\u201cEdgar and I were both stationed at Rask for many years. He\u2019s got the advantage of knowing the area and everything else, but he also has to know that the place tends towards lawlessness. He might be able to easily conquer towns, but the manpower involved in keeping them under control is a constant drain. Not to brag, but if it hadn\u2019t been for me keeping a tight leash on things there, the Empire would\u2019ve never gotten control of it as well as they did.\n\u201cHeh, well the ED has several eternals to keep a tight leash on it as you say.\u201d\n\u201cAnd those eternals aren\u2019t me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you seem to be in proud mood today.\u201d\n\u201cJust stating the facts.\u201d\n\u201cI see, well in any case that brings me to the next bit of news. You may be getting a transfer soon.\u201d\n\u201cTransfer? Why?\u201d\n\u201cWell the king and several others have always been uncomfortable with you in charge of the armies here on the frontlines as you probably know. It\u2019s only due to the threat of the potential invasion and my circle\u2019s influence that we managed to keep you in power here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? After all their worrying about an invasion for years, you mean they\u2019re suddenly not anymore, because Edgar\u2019s attacking Rask? That\u2019s pretty fucking short sighted.\u201d You say.\n\u201cNo, the intention is to still keep up the defenses here and keep the same procedures you set in place of course, but just uh, replace you.\u201d\n\u201cRight, because I could suddenly raise an army and try to overthrow the throne at any given time\u2026fuck. I thought you were supposed to calm those fears!\u201d\n\u201cI tried! I really did! I mean I think I\u2019m lucky we accomplished what we did! And I tried to fight for you on this too, but it\u2019s just too much now and they want you gone. It\u2019ll make everyone feel better.\u201d\n\u201cYes, everyone but me obviously.\u201d\n\u201cHey you\u2019ve always claimed to be a soldier dedicated to the kingdom for good or bad. Isn\u2019t this one of those times where you stepping down quietly to make everyone feel better would be best for the kingdom, instead of causing a fuse and potentially causing more problems?\u201d\n\u201cSo I accept this, and then what happens? Where am I getting transferred to? Some fort in the middle of nowhere again?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s just it, you\u2019re kind of going to be transferred to the uh\u2026private sector. Are you familiar the merchant\u2019s guild at the capital? Well, you\u2019ll be the new head of security there!\u201d Klemto says trying to make it sound impressive.\n\nYou can\u2019t believe this.\n\n\u201cAre you telling me I\u2019m not even going to be part of the damn army anymore? I\u2019m just going to be a glorified guard?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be well paid and get a better place to stay than this dreary fort!\u201d\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t give a shit about all that, I\u2019m a warrior! I want to fight!\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s still an option! I mean it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be sitting around doing nothing. In fact with the guild could use a little extra protection since the rise in anti-gnomism going on lately.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, there\u2019s some of that going on here too, right now.\u201d\n\nKlempto seems like he wants to pat your arm reassure you, but decides better of it.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry about all this. It sucks I know, but the popular opinion is just not in our favor. That\u2019s why we want you at the guild; most of my faction of likeminded fellows are there. We think we could still remedy this later.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d think with all your influence and control of the economy you\u2019d be able to do something about this now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well it isn\u2019t as easy as you think.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well it could be.\u201d You say.\n\nKlempto musters up all his courage and points a finger at you.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to hear you talking like that anymore! I know what you\u2019re implying and the answer is no! Unlike you humans, we gnomes don\u2019t kill one another despite our disagreements! Now I suggest you prepare for your transfer, take care of all your affairs here and a carriage will come and get you in a few days. I suppose you\u2019ll want that Dawn girl to take over here, which will be acceptable. I managed to convince the opposition of that.\u201d\n\u201cGee, thanks for small favors.\u201d\n\nAt this point Klemto just backs away from you and begins to leave, before he does though he speaks once more.\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, you shouldn\u2019t really see this as a bad thing. I mean think about how old you are getting. You humans don\u2019t have that high of a life span. Shouldn\u2019t you want to start slowing down on the war and battle a bit and start concentrating on enjoying your approaching elderly years?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still trying to convince me you\u2019re failing miserably, because that\u2019s the biggest load of shit I\u2019ve ever heard for several reasons that I\u2019m not even going to get into. But I\u2019ll address the age thing briefly. Yeah I know I\u2019m not twenty, but I fucking know I\u2019m still a better warrior than any of the soldiers under my command, let alone an average Felkan soldier. And while you keep saying I\u2019m human, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a fucking Eternal. We\u2019re better than a normal human and when the ED invades they\u2019re going to SHOW you that they are mainly because they aren\u2019t afraid to do whatever it kill their enemies, unlike you lot.\u201d\n\nSensing he better leave this time, Klemto quickly runs off out of your office, leaving you to ponder your situation. Just last night you were feeling good in the arms of Dawn, and now you got a bunch of shit shoved at you that you\u2019re supposed to just sit and eat it.\n\nIt\u2019s enough for you to attack the Eternal Dominion anyway", "action_results": [{"action": "Follow orders", "result": "As much as you don\u2019t like it, if even a third of what Klemto said is true, if you went ahead and did your own thing again, you could very well destabilize the kingdom even more, possibly even a civil war. You aren\u2019t looking to become like Kane, and if it means you have to step down to preserve the kingdom, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. It just frustrates you that after all you\u2019ve done, you still aren\u2019t trusted, but perhaps it will always be this way. If anything its perhaps something of a phenomenon that they accepted you in the first place, though if Warrick is anything to go by, it\u2019s only to exploit you.\n\nResigned to your orders, you make preparations to pass your command to Dawn. She doesn\u2019t like the news any better than you do, in fact she suggests that you should attack the Eternal Dominion anyway, but you explain the repercussions of such actions.\n\n\u201cBut you did that with the gnolls and that worked out!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and that was a different situation. Don\u2019t have the luxury of doing whatever anymore even if I do think it would be in the kingdom\u2019s best interest. Listen, you\u2019re going to be in charge here, so I don\u2019t want you doing anything rash either. No point in you getting into trouble, you understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I still don\u2019t like this. And I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I, but we have our orders.\u201d\n\u201cWell maybe you like your orders, but I still don\u2019t. If you\u2019re not going to be commander here, then I don\u2019t want to serve here anymore either.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! You can\u2019t just throw away your career like that because of me! Besides without me here, this place is going to need a good leader.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about all that. I care about you, and if the kingdom isn\u2019t seeing fit to give you the respect you deserve then it doesn\u2019t deserve me as a leader. Besides if all is so great as they claim then they won\u2019t need me there.\u201d\n\u201cI really think you should think this through. Besides what are you going to do, if not this?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure with my vast skill set, I\u2019ll find something, I\u2019ll also probably move to the capital and get married.\u201d\n\u201cMarried?\u201d you say not grasping her insinuation immediately, then when she touches your hand, you get it.\n\nA lot of upcoming changes has been dumped on you this day, you just hope you can adapt to all of them.\n\nYear 58\n\nThe Eternal Dominion gains ground every day, yet the people here in the capital act like everything is going well. If you\u2019d attacked like you wanted to, the Felkan Kingdom wouldn\u2019t have gotten caught off guard like it did. Warrick and whatever other spies the Felkan Kingdom had on the field were all fed bad intel, and while the soldiers in the Gan province fought well, the commander who was put in charge of the province was an idiot that allowed most of it get overrun. Even if shitty intel, you\u2019re damn sure that you would\u2019ve at least prevented that from happening. Dawn would\u2019ve too.\n\nYou regret not ignoring orders and going through with your plan. Dawn isn\u2019t as hard on herself, but she does sometimes wonders if she should\u2019ve stayed on as commander of the Gan armies. But it\u2019s too late for any of that now. The pair of you just go about your less exciting lives. She a combat instructor at an academy and you still head of security for the merchant\u2019s guild.\n\nIn the beginning your job was slightly more engaging, with all the anti-gnome stuff going on. You even prevented a nutjob from blowing up the guild once. Nowadays the anti-gnome sentiment has more or less disappeared. It\u2019s sort of hard to be angry at the little guys who are continuing to make weapons that blow up an enemy that\u2019s bashing the door down.\n\nAs a result you\u2019re mostly attempting to figure out the best guards for the various caravans that get sent out. Sometimes you go out on these as well just to break up the monotony. Predictably they\u2019re always supply caravans to the frontlines so you can get the latest and best information on what\u2019s going on, because the gods know that they never claim anything bad is going on in the capital.\n\nHere, closer to the fighting is where you feel a little more comfortable. You really miss it. While your current married life with Dawn is good, and you have no major worries, you still feel the call of war, but you are unable to participate. It\u2019s a very frustrating situation that you never get used to and you never will. It\u2019s just not in your nature.\n\nOne day on one of your supply runs, you travel to a town called Yevdin which is in desperate need of almost everything as it is being held by only a few soldiers. Most of the civilians have evacuated save for a few of the stubborn ones unwilling to run. You respect that.\n\nIt\u2019s of some surprise that you meet Warrick there; he\u2019s equally surprised to see you as well. While you wait for the supplies to be unloaded, you go over and speak to him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d Warrick asks.\n\u201cStaving off the boredom of my current assignment, and you?\u201d\n\u201cWaiting for my impending death.\u201d\n\u201cWell at least your punishment will be over soon\u2026I thought you were a captain. Why are you a sergeant now?\u201d\n\u201cGot busted down for being wrong on the intelligence reports, all those years ago. I guess I should be lucky I didn\u2019t get executed for gross incompetence. I really fucked up on that one.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d say you\u2019re in good company as far as that\u2019s concerned, so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Besides even if you\u2019d done your mission right, you might\u2019ve just gotten drummed out of the military altogether.\u201d You say.\nAfter a brief discussion with Warrick, you learn that this town is facing an imminent large-scale invasion. Not that the town is really important, but it happens to be in the way of another important target, so it\u2019s going to be overrun on the way. These supplies aren\u2019t so much as to ensure the soldiers\u2019 survival, but rather their survival long enough to make it a costly victory for the Eternal Dominion. Warrick doesn\u2019t appear to be concerned though.\n\n\u201cSo, I never did get the whole story, why\u2019d you get removed?\u201d Warrick asks\n\u201cLong story, but let\u2019s just say I think the ones running things like things the way they are right now.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking. Why would anyone in the Felkan Kingdom want this situation?\u201d\n\nYou could tell Warrick all about the things you\u2019ve overheard, things you\u2019ve suspected and things you\u2019ve outright seen just by being closer to the gnomes in the merchant\u2019s guild. But it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. Warrick\u2019s been on a string for a long time now and despite his own situation, he seems in a very positive mood. Perhaps ignorance is bliss, or perhaps its because he\u2019s still fighting and doing what he always was meant to do. The same thing you were meant to do.\n\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019ve delivered the stuff, let\u2019s get the hell outta here!\u201d the gnome merchant shouts to you.\n\u201cYou go on ahead with the rest of the guards. I\u2019m staying here.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat?! Are you crazy? This place is about to be destroyed!\u201d\n\u201cYeah I know. Tell my wife I really tried, but that this is what I was meant to do.\u201d\n\nThe gnome doesn\u2019t try to talk you out of your plan, he just shakes his head and gets in the carriage ordering the rest of the guards to ride off as quick as possible. Warrick says nothing about your decision either. Even though the pair of you haven\u2019t really been in close contact since you both served together in Nalin, he knows why you made your decision.\n\nThe next few days aren\u2019t filled with impending doom, but rather one of contentment. In between keeping a look out, and checking your defenses you and Warrick do a lot of catching up on the past, though the pair of you mostly stick to the happier memories of when you both were in the Empire. The other soldiers listen in on your stories. They don\u2019t quite get all of them, but seeing the good spirits of their leader, seems to put them in a slightly better mood as well. And that\u2019s good, their last moments should be as unpleasant as possible, there will be plenty of time for that when the Eternal Dominion arrives.\n\nEventually the Eternal Dominion arrives with an impressively large force. The small part of you that believed you\u2019d make this out alive shortly disappears, but this doesn\u2019t make you second-guess yourself. You\u2019re still comfortable in your decision and this is certainly preferable to what you\u2019ve been doing for the past three years.\n\n\u201cSir, it\u2019s been an honor to serve with you.\u201d Warrick suddenly says to you, even giving you the old Empire salute.\n\u201cThe honor is both of ours.\u201d You say.\n\u201cFor the Empire, sir.\u201d\n\u201cFor the Empire, Warrick.\u201d You reply.\n\nThe first volley of cannon shots strike the front ranks of the Eternal Dominion troops and the battle is joined\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPrime Eternal, the town of Yevdin was taken, but we suffered massive casualties, we need reinforcements before we can take Fort Everlast.\u201d A messenger says.\n\u201cWhat?! You idiots! You see what we\u2019re working with here Brenda? I expect this sort of incompetence from our human soldiers, but that army had a good portion of Eternals in it! Bah! These new ones for all their extra abilities, they still lack that spark that we have!\u201d Edgar cursed.\n\u201cWhy did we suffer so many losses at Yevdin? Do the Felkans have a new weapon?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cReports indicate no new weapon, but there were a group of soldiers that seemed to be incredibly determined. Even when the town was taken, a few of them had taken to an underground shelter beneath the town and skirmished with the force for five more days.\u201d\n\u201cWe should be so lucky to have Eternals such dedication.\u201d Edgar mutters.\n\u201cAny description of these enemy soldiers?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\nThe messenger reports that there was nothing out of the ordinary about any of the soldiers and doesn\u2019t have a description since he didn\u2019t know that it was important. He says he knows the leader had an eye patch which clues Edgar and Brenda that that was Warrick.\n\nHe also mentions one other that wasn\u2019t in a soldier uniform, but was the last to be killed. Edgar and Brenda briefly wonder a bit, and then nod to each other before dismissing the messenger.\n\n\u201cIt was stupid of the Felkans to remove him from command in the first place, but I guess even they couldn\u2019t keep him off the battlefield forever.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cNo, and that was that spark I was referring to earlier. Just think if the pair of them had stayed here instead? Think of all the things we could\u2019ve accomplished! Such a waste. Well it\u2019s over now and with those two out of the way, I think our plan is going to be a lot easier.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but I still wish things had been different.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I Brenda, so do I.\u201d", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Disobey orders", "result": "You wouldn\u2019t have gotten promoted if you hadn\u2019t reported Captain Eckers, and you wouldn\u2019t have gotten this command if you hadn\u2019t took it upon yourself to launch an attack on the gnolls. The fact is, throughout most of your life, you\u2019ve followed orders, but it\u2019s only when you\u2019ve taken matters into your own hands on important decisions that you\u2019ve gotten anywhere.\n\nWhy should this time be any different?\n\nFor one thing, just because there are reports that the ED aren\u2019t planning an invasion any time soon, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s true. Not that you doubt Warrick\u2019s skills as a spy, but there\u2019s always a possibility that false information is being leaked intentionally and that someone is on to him. Hell, maybe its even Brenda pretending to be on his side, you don\u2019t know.\n\nThe other thing is even if the info is true it\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t still invade during or after their invasion of Rask. And it would be better to catch THEM off guard instead of the other way around, because you\u2019re pretty sure they aren\u2019t expecting the Felkan Kingdom to attack first.\n\nYou\u2019re most likely going to get into a shitload of trouble for all this, but when you get this war started, the ED isn\u2019t going to listen to diplomacy, when they get attacked; they\u2019re not going to stop. When that happens the kingdom isn\u2019t going to have any choice but to help you. Or it could just backfire horribly.\n\nIt\u2019s all a gamble, but one you\u2019re willing to risk, because you\u2019re damned if you\u2019re going to grow old and just become a guard for fat gnome merchants after all you\u2019ve done and sacrificed. And if you die in battle, then it\u2019ll be a death you\u2019ve been destined for since birth.\n\nYou find Dawn and tell her that you want orders put out to all the forts in the province. A full offensive across the Arat border and into ED territory is to be launched.\n\n\u201cSo the ED is invading soon?\u201d Dawn asks.\n\u201cNo, but after we destroy a couple of their forts and towns they will be. Have the message sent out that all forces are to converge on that ED town about twenty miles past the border, Bucklesberg. I\u2019ll meet the rest of the battalion commanders there and plan the next attack after the place has been razed to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re going?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m leading this attack personally. I\u2019m not some helpless old man you know!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say\u2026wait, this plan isn\u2019t official is it? What did that gnome tell you?\u201d\n\u201cA bunch of shit as usual. Now I\u2019m going to need you here to keep things orderly on this side of the border. It might get ugly, but I know you can handle it. Just remember, we\u2019re doing this for the good of the kingdom, even if its leaders are too stupid to see it.\u201d\n\nDawn looks a little concerned and it reminds you of when you first asked her to completely wipe out a gnoll village, but then she proves herself, as you knew she would.\n\n\u201cIt will be done, my love.\u201d She says and leaves to send out the messengers.\n\nYou order all troops in the fort to ready themselves for battle save for a skeleton crew to protect the fort. When they\u2019re completely ready, you ride your horse up and down the line of them and are glad to see the dedication they are displaying. You can see that they have no need for any sort of long-winded motivating speech; they\u2019ve been anticipating this moment for years, just as you have.\n\n\u201cFor the kingdom!\u201d you shout which is followed by a loud cheer from your soldiers, then your army begins its march to war.\n\nWhen you get within a mile of Bucklesburg, a scout reports that the town isn\u2019t completely undefended. In fact there is a larger than normal group of soldiers there along with Eternals. There may even be a mage there.\n\n\u201cHmm, it might appear that Edgar might\u2019ve been amassing troops to prepare for an invasion after all, either that or he\u2019s just distrustful. Doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re killing everything there anyway.\u201d\n\nThe battle of Bucklesburg is a massacre. The ED puts up as good a fight as they could have, but ultimately they\u2019re overrun and outnumbered. The town is completely burned to the ground and the only survivors are the few villagers that had sense to run when you were seen coming in the distance.\n\nThis is just the first step of the plan. When the rest of your soldiers arrive from the other forts you march again.\n\nBy day nine, you\u2019ve taken one the Eternal Dominion\u2019s forts. It\u2019s very damaged from the fighting, but you figure it will serve as a temporary base of operations while you plan your next attacks. After this battle you\u2019ve also confirmed from various documents that you\u2019ve found in the commander\u2019s office that Edgar WAS planning to invade the kingdom, meaning you were right to attack.\n\nOn day sixteen you get a message from Dawn, stating that the entire Gan province has been declared \u201cunder hostile control\u201d and that all fort commanders are to relinquish their control to the kingdom immediately. Naturally this hasn\u2019t happened, but the rest of the kingdom\u2019s soldiers are supposedly being prepared to take back the province by force, however there is a lot of civil unrest going on as well due to some of the public opinion openly agreeing with conquest. She says that it\u2019s part of the anti-gnome movement that claims they\u2019ve been keeping the kingdom weak on purpose. She also says she is doing everything in her power to keep control of the Gan province and sends her love.\n\nOn day twenty-two you get a visitor to Fort Ruin (as you\u2019ve renamed it).\n\n\u201cHello Klemto, I hope your journey here wasn\u2019t too dangerous, we\u2019ve been trying to keep the road to the kingdom somewhat safe.\u201d You say.\n\u201cEternal, we\u2019ve got a lot to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I suspect we do. So here, this\u2019ll save time.\u201d You say and throw a journal at Klemto who catches it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ex-captain of this fort journal. Makes mention of all the plans for the invasion on the kingdom, as well as a few amusing sexual desires. Second generation eternals certainly are a twisted bunch even when brought under control.\u201d\n\u201cAt least they can be brought under control, which is more than can be said for you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m did this for the kingdom and the proof is right there that I\u2019m right! Don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019ve got more official documents I can give you.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right! It never fucking mattered! What you were supposed to do is obey orders! You pushed a boundary that\u2019s too far this time I can\u2019t fix this! Not now!\u201d\n\u201cI question if you ever could in the first place. I\u2019m sure you only kept me around as long as it served your purpose. Build up the pitiful defenses along the Felkan borders and then just get shuffled off to defend your fat merchants because they\u2019re getting death threats from bigots that actually have a point whether they even know it or not. Face it, YOU fuckers helped create the Felkan government and you share part of the problems with it. Me? I\u2019m just serving it. I told you before, I pledged myself to the kingdom, but my only stipulation was that I do things my way and that I not be held back in doing it. You got in my way and I had no choice, but to defy you. You can\u2019t give a sword to me, and tell me not to kill the enemy with it. That\u2019s what a fucking sword is for.\u201d\n\nKlemto, rubs a hand over his face and sits down in silence. His face has a slightly gaunt appearance than you last remember it. Every time you\u2019ve seen him he\u2019s always been dressed very nice, but even his expensive clothing is a bit disheveled, even a small tear in his jacket. He takes a deep breath and speaks.\n\n\u201cMajor, you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on back home do you?\u201d\n\u201cDawn sent me a letter recently about a week ago about some of what\u2019s going on. I hear the Gan province has been declared hostile and the rest of the kingdom army is planning to retake it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and even that is being put on hold, you know why? Because somebody blew up the merchant\u2019s guild two days ago! The day before? A duke was executed for conspiracy to kill the fucking king! At this point the Eternal Dominion doesn\u2019t need to invade us, the Felkan Kingdom will be in ruins by the time their armies even arrive! You haven\u2019t saved the kingdom, you\u2019ve destroyed it!\u201d he shouts with his eyes beginning to water and nearly hyperventilating the whole time. You have to say, you\u2019ve never seen him ever this upset. You quickly get some water from a nearby pitcher and pour him a glass.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do\u2026I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do\u2026\u201d he says in between drinks.\n\u201cLook calm down Klemto, maybe it isn\u2019t as bad as you think.\u201d You tell him.\n\u201cBad? It\u2019s fucking tragic! With the destruction of the merchant\u2019s guild, the economy is going to go down the fucking privy hole, the king is an ineffectual idiot that\u2019ll probably be successfully assassinated in a couple months, we\u2019re suffering from civil revolts, we got a rogue province and on top of everything we\u2019re at war with the Eternal Dominion!\u201d\n\nSounds pretty familiar.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe it is as bad as you say. The question is what are YOU going to do about it?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cDo? What can I do? I\u2019m just one gnome! I\u2019m hated in general by most non-gnomes and even most of my own people since they personally blame me, for having a hand in allowing you to be in charge of all the military in Gan. Even most of my friends that agreed with me were all killed in the bombing! I have nobody to help me fix this!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong there, you\u2019ve got me. Look, take all these documents concerning the invasion plans, and do your best in convincing everyone and anyone important that this first strike was very necessary. If you\u2019re telling me that the king already is in danger of being assassinated\u2026well maybe it\u2019ll be best to let that happen and place someone who is more likely to support the cause. I have to imagine that there\u2019s some power hungry royal ready to step up to the task.\u201d\n\u201cAssassinate the king, this is what it\u2019s come to? I don\u2019t know maybe you\u2019re even right, it\u2019s just I really hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. We gnomes have been puppet masters, but we\u2019ve never engaged in assassination tactics before.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re going to have to forget your previous tactics if you want the kingdom to survive regardless of who is actually on the throne. It\u2019s either that or cut your losses and leave like I did with the Empire. I caution you though, if you truly believe in the kingdom and love it like I think you do, you might later regret that decision.\u201d\n\nKlemto calms down a bit and looks at you to see that you speak from experience with that last remark. And it is true; there is a part of you that misses the Empire for all its faults. You\u2019re making the best of things and you even manage to be content most of the time, but there is always something \u201cmissing\u201d and you can\u2019t get it back.\n\n\u201cOkay, Eternal. Okay. Hand me all the documents that you mentioned, and I\u2019ll get started on a plan. (Sigh) I just hope you can hold back the full wrath of the Eternal Dominion all by yourself.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that, I brought this problem on, so I\u2019ll be the one to take care of it. Just try to keep the rest of the Felkan army off of my back, even if they aren\u2019t going to help.\u201d\n\nKlemto leaves with the documents and you return to your duties. You can\u2019t be sure what\u2019s going to become of the kingdom, but one thing is certain, you aren\u2019t going to abandon your duty like last time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 58\n\nYour soldiers stand ready at camp as a single enemy approaches you. He shows no fear and has a look of determination and blazing fury in his eyes. He might even be able to cut down everyone in his path just to get to you, but that won\u2019t be necessary, as you have ordered everyone to stand down. This is between you and him. He\u2019s an Eternal, a true one that you once served with, if either of you are to die today, it should at the hands of the other. No others are worthy.\n\nHe\u2019s stood in opposition to you for a few years now and now that his side has finally lost completely, his side has resorted to acts of desperation to continue a long lost battle. This is just another example of that desperation.\n\nThe pair of you look at each other and say nothing. It wouldn\u2019t do any good anyway, neither of you is going listen. You both believed in the same thing once, but not anymore. In his eyes you ruined all that.\n\nThe two of you clash swords.\n\nYou remember when you saw him after a long stretch of distance from each other; you felt a sense of relief. There you were in a hostile environment not exactly knowing what would come next and you saw a friendly face that was more than willing to help out.\n\nYou land a kick to his stomach and smash his face with the pommel of your sword, destroying several of his teeth. He staggers back mouth filled with blood, but manages to block your next attack.\n\nAfter that last time you saw him you were soon separated again. Oh sure, you heard about him, and he probably heard about your deeds as well, but you haven\u2019t actually seen each other until this moment. No matter who wins, it\u2019s going to be the last time.\n\nYou feel the deep cut of the sword sinking into your shoulder. Fighting through the pain, you manage to keep a firm grip of your sword and swing it into his side. You both hear a crack signaling that not only have you opened up a severe wound, but also broken a rib or two. He reels back from you as his side now drips red with gore. He\u2019s unsteady and breathing hard, but he\u2019s not going to stop. He\u2019s got nothing left to lose. If you were in his shoes, you wouldn\u2019t stop either.\n\nThe funny thing about this is you always thought you\u2019d be having this battle with Edgar, not Warrick.\n\nA slash at your leg brings you down to one knee, but Warrick isn\u2019t able to capitalize on bringing his sword down on your head, since you slash upward into his groin. He screams out, dropping his weapon and you painfully lift yourself up on your one good leg and land your own strike across his head. The sickening sound of skull meeting metal is heard and he falls to the ground with blood and brains leaking out the side. He gurgles a few unintelligible things, but some of it starts to form complete thoughts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026? Wha\u2026what are you doing here? I thought\u2026you were still stationed in \u2026Rask\u2026 I\u2026don\u2019t rem\u2026gnomes\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter all this time, his memory is starting to come back. Your hit to his head, must\u2019ve done something. You kneel down beside his bloody body and provide him a better last memory.\n\n\u201cI was sent here to help you Warrick. It was a very important mission for the Empire. You got blown up by a trap, but we succeeded Warrick. We won. Remember this.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2026won\u2026yeah\u2026we\u2026\u201d Warrick mumbles and then finally expires.\n\nYou tell your soldiers to burn his body and not to disturb you for the rest of day, despite the medic insisting that you really should have your wounds seen to.\n\nYou sit in your tent in silence trying to rationalize killing yet another one of your former comrade in arms. He was trying to kill you. Warrick was on the wrong side of the civil war. A new king had to be installed and new policies had to be implemented. It had to be done, to protect the kingdom. Just like you had to kill Kane to protect the Empire\u2026\n\nIt was a shitty end to an honorable man, but death by your hand is probably the best thing you could\u2019ve done for him and at least in his final moments he believed he was elsewhere. You sometime wish you were.\n\nThe next day, you get your wounds properly patched up and get back to the business of holding off the Eternal Dominion, which hasn\u2019t been the same since Edgar was assassinated last year. Apparently the new eternals didn\u2019t agree with his leadership since it wasn\u2019t producing the results they wanted. They might not have agreed with it, but he was doing better than whoever the idiot that\u2019s in charge now is.\n\nYou wonder what happened to Brenda, you knew she was up there with Edgar in ranking, but since she\u2019s not in charge of the ED you can only assume that she was killed along with Edgar. You\u2019re the last one left and you think back to Gruz\u2019s last words to you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll outlive everyone\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s finally come true.\n\nYear 65\n\nMore aches and pains as you slowly get out of bed. With every passing year you feel more of them and it\u2019s getting to a point where you can\u2019t reasonably get into the thick of battle anymore with sword in hand. Sure you\u2019re still a good fighter, but you\u2019re slowing down and don\u2019t have the strength that you once did. Of course some would say you weren\u2019t supposed to be doing that anyway as a leader should stay in the back and give orders from behind the safety of his soldiers. But then you always did cling to your old ways.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not like you need to anymore, as the Eternal Dominion hasn\u2019t been a threat in years. You knew they\u2019d fall apart soon after Edgar died. Their territory or what\u2019s left of it basically consists of petty warlords fighting each other more than fighting anyone else, let along the kingdom. Nowadays your job as a general mostly consists of pushing a few bits around on a map. Sometimes you still try to remain active by visiting areas that are experiencing heavy combat.\n\nWith no real opposition anymore and a stronger king in charge, the Felkan Kingdom is entering a period of aggressive expansion. With the newly acquired Arat province under control right now the king is looking towards Rask due to its resources. Diplomatic feelers were sent to see if the towns up there would join willingly, but no luck. You know from experience how difficult it is to hold, as the land is wild and its people are fiercely independent minded especially since they threw off the shackles of Empire rule and aren\u2019t willing to have another large government tell them what to do.\n\nWhile you\u2019re certainly the most qualified to carry out an invasion on Rask, you aren\u2019t sure if you still have the energy anymore. Granted you wouldn\u2019t be personally, but you still remember the headaches of holding the place. Ever since Dawn retired to become an instructor, she\u2019s been dropping hints about you retiring as well. Perhaps it\u2019s time to follow in your wife\u2019s footsteps and join her.", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue as general", "result": "You can\u2019t retire, at least not yet. Despite your aches, pains, and old age, you still feel the call of war within and the fire of it still hasn\u2019t disappeared from you. You wonder if it ever will, but until that time, your place is on the battlefield despite your diminished capacity.\n\nWithin a few months the decree in passed. Rask is to be invaded, as you knew it would. You know how the powers in charge work. They want results and they want them fast so you\u2019re going to try your best to provide just that, you amass a large army and send it forth to conquer. Since you\u2019ve got access to more powerful weapons this time, perhaps this invasion won\u2019t be as difficult as you think if you show an overwhelming display of force.\n\nThe first strike is against Kenneth\u2019s Rest which you once knew as Fort Destiny. The place apparently had been converted into a hang out for mercenaries and a trading spot. Your army faces a lot of dark elven mercenaries that were enjoying their pay at the time, but most of them flee seeing as there isn\u2019t any profit in defending a place they don\u2019t actually have any loyalty to.\n\nWhen Kenneth\u2019s Rest is taken, you ride out to it so you can carry out your orders closer to the action.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll be leaving soon again?\u201d Dawn asks.\n\u201cYou know how it is, if I don\u2019t make a personal appearance they\u2019re likely to fuck up my orders.\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t handle it themselves?\u201d\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m sure they could, I\u2019m still the most familiar with the area. I think it would be best if I went there myself. Dawn, you shouldn\u2019t really worry. I mean I\u2019m not even going to be on the frontlines and there were more times in the past of when I could\u2019ve been killed.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s just I dunno, when we got married and as we both get older I suppose I just figured we\u2019d settle down a bit more so we could enjoy our remaining time together.\u201d\n\u201cLike a normal married couple?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d\n\u201cDawn, I think you know you didn\u2019t exactly marry a normal person.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know that too. Still, I do wonder when you\u2019ll eventually realize that you don\u2019t need to prove yourself anymore. I think everyone knows you aren\u2019t an armchair general. Ever since the new king took the throne, you\u2019ve actually had nothing but support. I\u2019m pretty sure your name will go down in history.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about that, I pledged myself to this kingdom and its survival. Part of that is me making sure this invasion of Rask doesn\u2019t go badly, because while we\u2019re on top now, I\u2019d rather make sure we stay that way and it doesn\u2019t become a drain on our kingdom which then has a chain reaction of making things worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t abandon your duty.\u201d Dawn says to you.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you ask, turning to face her.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t abandon your duty to the Empire. I know that\u2019s why you try so hard here and still do. I\u2019ve always known that the first time you told me of your past. You always speak in such a way about it with a mix of regret and frustration yet always with a sense of pride. You still struggle with that one thing that you consider a failure on your part, when if you think about it\u2026it was the best thing you ever did.\u201d\n\nYou hold Dawn\u2019s hand and the pair of you look at each other\u2019s wedding rings. She has an argument that can\u2019t be debated as far as that is concerned. If you hadn\u2019t left the Empire when you did, you doubt if you would\u2019ve been married. Most likely you probably would\u2019ve gotten a knife in the back by one of those treacherous new eternals by this point.\n\nYou hold Dawn tightly and kiss her, before explaining.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right of course. It was the best thing I could\u2019ve done, but that\u2019s not the whole picture. I was raised different than anyone in the Felkan Kingdom, hell I was raised different than most in the Empire. I was brought up not just for war, battle and combat, but also to this ideal. An ideal that wasn\u2019t reality unfortunately, but there it was still implanted in my mind regardless. The thing is while that ideal barely existed in the Empire as I knew it, I see the spark of it coming to pass here in the Felkan Kingdom, and it\u2019s like I finally belong here and I want to be apart of it\u2019s glory as much as I can before I\u2019m too old to be of any more use. Maybe I\u2019m trying to live out the rest of my life as IF the Empire had never fallen. Perhaps that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing all along for the past few decades.\u201d\n\nDawn nods and understands, but you know she would still prefer you to stay closer to home.\n\n\u201cSomeday Dawn, someday.\u201d You tell her before you leave for Rask.\n\nYou almost feel like history repeating itself when you enter Kenneth\u2019s Rest, though it\u2019s a comforting feeling.\n\nUsing Kenneth\u2019s Rest as your base of operations in the Rask province, you decide the next attack should be the largest town in the region, which is Keplavisk. While Rask doesn\u2019t strictly have a proper central government, Keplavisk is the closest thing to a capital. Take that out and everything else should be a lot easier. You tell your captain that when he enters the smoldering ruins of the town to relay a message to the survivors.\n\n\u201cTell them that the Bane of Rask has returned.\u201d\n\nYear 75\n\nYou have to admit, that while retirement has it\u2019s good and bad points, you think you\u2019ve finally gotten your \u201cstruggle\u201d out of your system now. You initially thought after you retired you would still have that \u201cpull\u201d but you don\u2019t. Your successful campaign in Rask was truly a bookend of sorts. Maybe it was a kind of closure for you.\n\nYour retirement basically consists of you spending a lot of time with Dawn which is time well spent as you grow old together. You sometimes wonder if Dawn wanted children, though she never specifically addressed it. Nature never took its course in that area. Dawn is about twenty years younger than you, and she was still in her childbearing years when you first got together. You don\u2019t think it was a problem with her though, you hold the belief that it probably was with you. Perhaps Eternals weren\u2019t meant to reproduce, or maybe you weren\u2019t. Still, you know that Roldan and Brenda never had any children that you know of, so you maintain the belief that it\u2019s one of the limitations of an Eternal. After all if an Eternal could breed offspring his attention might not be solely on war.\n\nBesides your time with Dawn, you sometimes fill your time giving instruction at one of the military academies. You attend the occasional special royal event and recently you just accepted an award for everything you\u2019ve done for the kingdom. There are also plans on having a statue made of you, but that isn\u2019t set in stone (literally) yet.\n\nYou sometimes walk down the streets of the capital and see how much it\u2019s changed in such a short time and continuing to thrive. Soldiers marching down the street keeping order. Citizens going about their business, proud of their nation and not trying to overthrow anything.\n\nThis is what the Empire should\u2019ve been like.\n\nThis is what you were taught to believe in.\n\nAnd it fills you with happiness that it was you that was part of making this come true.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Retire", "result": "As much as you might like to go on, you decide that perhaps it is finally time to pass the torch to younger and more energetic men and women than yourself. You also know it would probably make Dawn happier. You\u2019ve done quite a bit for the Felkan Kingdom and served as well as you could have under the circumstances. You just wish you had time to do more, or at least the youth, if not the time.\n\nWhen you step down, its sort of a surprise to the entire Felkan military, they always figured you\u2019d never willingly step down and probably die in office. Even the new ruling class is a little disappointed to see you leave, you were after all instrumental in their rise to power.\n\nA small service celebrating your years of dedication to the Felkan Kingdom is held which you naturally attend and you even give a small speech. It\u2019s all very patriotic and keeps the up the morale and optimistic outlook of the kingdom for everyone. Shortly after your retirement, you do indulge in the frivolities of said retirement; this pretty much consists of not doing much of anything or spending time with Dawn. It\u2019s fun for a while.\n\nWhen you start to keep up on the news on the Rask invasion, you become increasingly dismayed by what your successor is doing. There are victories at first, but they eventually become costly ones. The Raskians begin organizing enough to make further conquest difficult.\n\nEventually several lower ranking officers begin calling for you to return if only as a consultant or strategic advisor. You actually would gladly volunteer as you definitely want to help the kingdom and you\u2019re starting to find your retired life a little boring. Unfortunately the current general doesn\u2019t want that, as he wants to take all the credit for the conquest of Rask and if he\u2019s able, to surpass your victories. The fool manages to sway the king in his favor by pointing out that they hold most of the territory and are plundering its resources. The king of course is just concerned with the bottom line, so he keeps him on.\n\nOf course the biggest problem with this, is it\u2019s incredibly short sighted. The Raskians sabotage their mines and fight a guerilla war that makes things even worse. Felkan soldiers die by the thousands over the course of several years and this begins to have a downward spiral. Not a grand one, but it\u2019s noticeable that the cracks are starting to show and people are beginning to protest again.\n\nYou don\u2019t agree with how the government is handling things, but you\u2019re a patriot to the end and one day you get into an argument with a group of them on the street. Dawn tells you to let it go, but the more they get in your face, the more you won\u2019t let it go and eventually you feel that call to violence again\u2026\n\nYou punch out one of the protestors, which causes more shouting from the rest of the crowd as well as the soldiers attempting to keep order. One the soldiers respectfully attempts to hold you back, but you continue to try to attack the rest of the protestors and screaming at them of how ungrateful they all are. With tensions heating up on all sides, it\u2019s only a matter of time before things escalate and somebody fires a shot and it isn\u2019t from the soldiers, it\u2019s from one of the protestors carrying a concealed pistol.\n\nYou feel the impact to your chest and fall to the ground as mass chaos erupts all around you. Dawn screams for a medic and attempts to drag you out of the way, but you\u2019re already coughing up blood and gasping for breath as the chest wound continues to bleed out your vital fluids.\n\n\u201cDawn\u2026(gasp, gurgle)\u201d is all you can utter before your heart stops beating.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Year 61 (Klemto's Lamentation)", "result": "As you think about your own possible future and if your \u201ctime\u201d has come to settle into old age and compromise, you also think back to another who was struggling with his own future\u2026\n\n\u201cEternal, come drink with me one last time!\u201d Klemto says sitting in a very basic chair near an equally unimpressive table. He\u2019s not drunk yet, but he will be soon, if he keeps drinking.\n\nYou take a quick glance at his home and most of it is very simplistic and lacks the luxury that he once had. It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s fallen on hard times now that the civil war has wrapped up. He no longer wears a suit; instead he has on a drab torn shirt and a pair of plain pants. Even one of his shoes has a hole in it.\n\n\u201cNo that\u2019s okay, Klem\u2026it is my understanding that all of the remaining gnomes in the kingdom are leaving on their own accord.

He\u2019s a fucking human. And all humans are alike, power hungry and ready to backstab someone as soon as they get it and crush all those when they get on top. I get it. They got short life spans.

I certainly can\u2019t do shit about it can I? Hell, I\u2019m just lucky I backed the right side of the civil war, otherwise we probably wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation and I\u2019d be in a mass grave right now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to look at things. By surviving you can still make a life for yourself and rebuild.\u201d\n\nKlemto bursts out laughing, spitting out most of his drink.\n\n\u201cOhhhh, that\u2019s a good one Eternal. I guess that\u2019s why I don\u2019t blame you either. You don\u2019t know any better.\u201d\n\u201cBlame me? I didn\u2019t put you in your current position.\u201d\n\u201cOh and you mean to say you had NOTHING at all to do with the current change in regime? The expansion of the Felkan Kingdom? Hell, even the rise in nationalistic fervor? You can stand here and look me in the fucking eye and say you had absolutely NOTHING to do with that?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026very well. Perhaps my actions did set certain events in motion, but I did it for the kingdom!\u201d\n\u201cRight! You\u2019re right. You DID do it for the kingdom and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t know any better. You aren\u2019t even human. You look like one. You sound like one. Hell, you must even have some feelings like one given your marriage. Still a little surprised about that one\u2026but like you once said to me, you aren\u2019t human.

My people\u2026my people escaped the slavery of the Empire centuries ago, and for what? For us to be practically destroyed by YOU. Whether you did it knowingly or not, you managed to complete the job. The Felkan Kingdom? It\u2019s not the Felkan Kingdom anymore. It\u2019s the fucking Empire. My people? My people are scattered and more divided in away that we\u2019ve ever known!

You really don\u2019t know how to respond at all. Part of you actually feel sorry for him, as odd as it may seem. You and he didn\u2019t always get along; you never really trusted him and you certainly never forgave his kind for what they did to Warrick...\n\nAnd yet, besides Dawn, he\u2019s the closest you\u2019ve had to a \u201cfriend\u201d since you\u2019ve been in the Felkan Kingdom. Despite all of what he is saying to you, the fact remains he did help you several times.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the problem lies\u2026\n\n\u201c(Sniff) And despite all of the damage you did, you are not to blame. We are, or rather I am. I was the fool who believed that you could bring about change for the better. I was the fool who helped you the entire time. There is no way you could\u2019ve gotten away with most of what you got away with had I not intervened with my connections and even convinced some of my fellows to go down the path to hell. If I had any of the great intelligence that we gnomes are supposed to be known for, you should\u2019ve been executed the first time we met, but I had to be an optimist. Idealism\u2026the disease of idiots.\u201d\n\nKlemto takes a long swig of his bottle draining it completely before throwing it to the floor.\n\n\u201cKlemto\u2026I did appreciate your help when you gave it. I mean that.\u201d\n\u201cI know you did, just wish I could help myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou can. Like I said, you\u2019re a survivor and intelligent. You can rebuild somewhere else maybe even better than ever.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, while I appreciate your words of encouragement Eternal, I don\u2019t think so. You see, I\u2019m not just an exile from the Felkan Kingdom, I\u2019m also an exile from my own people now, or what remains of them. Seems they blame me for what\u2019s happened as well\u2026I guess I can at least take solace in the fact that their hatred of me has kept them united them on some level.\u201d\n\u201cBut, surely you could make it on your own, somewhere!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. We gnomes have always been communal in nature. Perhaps in some ways we DO rely on integrating into other societies to protect us. Hopefully one day we won\u2019t and we\u2019ll carve out a land of our own. But in any case I won\u2019t be there to see it, and I\u2019m too old to try to make it on my own even if I was going to attempt such a mad plan. No Eternal, there comes a time in your life when you realize it\u2019s time to retire. I think I probably should\u2019ve done so a LONG time ago, but I stayed in the game because I thought I could do some more good. Instead I just made things worse, A LOT worse. Sometimes you have to look back at your past, smile at the good times, forget about the bad and enjoy old age. Unfortunately for me there are too many bad times to forget and no place for me to enjoy the good times\u2026\u201d\n\nYou begin to get a little apprehensive by Klemto\u2019s tone and words.\n\n\u201cKlem\u2026\u201d\n\nKlemto suddenly pulls out a flintlock pistol and points it to his head.\n\n\u201cGoodbye Eternal.\u201d\n\nAnd with those last words you saw Klemto blow his brains out.\n\nNaturally you don\u2019t have the same problems as he did, but perhaps he could\u2019ve been right about there coming a time to retire. Quitting while you\u2019re ahead so to speak, and not screwing up your past accomplishments by being too stubborn.\n\nYou certainly wouldn\u2019t want to end up in a hopeless position like poor Klemto.", "action_results": [null]}]}, {"action": "Year 56 (Wedding Day)", "result": "You never thought such a day would come for you, ever.

You are hardly surprised though; you knew it was bound to happen given what the gnomes did to him. Even Klemto, who managed to convince most of his brethren to join you, can\u2019t undo the unwavering loyalty they instilled in him.\n\nThe civil war pales in comparison to the war you\u2019re fighting with the Eternal Dominion, you might\u2019ve gotten an initial advantage over them, but they are certainly trying to make up for it now. Edgar must be enraged.\n\nBut none of that matters right now.\n\nA Felkan civil war and war with the Eternal Dominion, and still you are able to put all those more pressing conflicts aside to focus on Dawn. You look at her youthful face and into blue eyes and it makes you realize just how much younger she is than you. You wonder briefly if her youth is part of what makes her so desirable. Not for the superficial reasons that most would consider, but her youth itself. Looking at how young she is, makes you forget how old you are. You dismiss such thoughts, as you have enough aching joints and pains to always remind you how old you\u2019re getting.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s a much deeper connection and the pair of you knows that.

In the passing months, the captain never spouts off anything else to you so you figure you were right in your assumption that he was just venting. Nothing to major worry about except the increasing boredom of not having much to do at the fort. You haven\u2019t seen a gnoll in months now and you don\u2019t really like it. They\u2019ve never disappeared for this long of a stretch and it makes you suspect they could be up to something because you refuse to believe that they\u2019ve just decided to leave you alone.\n\nThe next time you see the captain, you tell him that you\u2019d like to take a platoon up into the hills to scout out the area, and while he says he\u2019d like to send you, he has his orders.\n\n\u201cBut you said yourself, that we could do a lot more good if we just went into the hills and wiped out all the gnolls.\u201d You point out.\n\u201cI know what I said that day, and perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have spoken out like that to a subordinate. (sigh) Look, despite my feelings on this situation I know I\u2019ve damaged my career enough as it is. If I go disobeying orders, I\u2019m just going to get myself in deeper. Besides if the gnolls have been as quiet as they have been perhaps we did kill them all, or at least scared them so much that they won\u2019t attack ever again.\u201d\n\nYou of course aren\u2019t convinced, but there is little you can do.

If you\u2019d stayed with the Empire instead of leaving it, you wouldn\u2019t be in this situation now. Even if you failed to keep it from collapsing, you would\u2019ve at least died honorably in its service.\n\nBut this? There will be no honor in this death.

The first two that step to you have their heads blown to gooey pieces with your flintlocks, and then you resort to tried and true methods of slaughter.\n\nYou hack down several of their number before suffering any major wounds. Even then, you continue to fight with the determination of ten men. The bodies of gnolls pile up, the blood is everywhere and you\u2019ve just suffered an injury that should\u2019ve rightfully killed you, but you continue to fight. All the anger you feel at this situation is being directed utterly towards the gnolls until it finally burns itself out and your body pushes itself past its limitations of physical exertion.\n\nAn axe cleaves into your skull, followed by another into your arm, severing it just enough to hang from a bit of tendon.

Even on the front lines and being involved in a lot of fighting, I saw all the corruption going on, the incompetence of lazy commanders\u2026it was like Captain Pollo multiplied by ten. I mean here we are trying to conquer an enemy that was somewhat equal to us as far as military and in some cases superior and we\u2019re just throwing soldiers into the field, without any regard for tactics or strategy!\u201d\n\u201cSounds pretty bad, last time I spoke to Gerald, he never mentioned all the problems.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well I think Gerald didn\u2019t like to focus on the negative, but trust me when I tell you it was a complete fuck up from beginning to end.

You sort of figured that maybe she had gotten killed, but a part of you sort of hoped that maybe she found a way out of the Empire as well. Seems silly to have a strong feeling about her given you hadn\u2019t seen her in so long and your one night tryst, but even not counting that, she was still a good officer that always played straight with you. The fact she got killed in a similar manner than Roldan did, certainly makes you feel that she deserved better.\n\nWarrick begins to notice your silence, and then you quickly pick the conversation up again.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026how did you lose your eye?\u201d\n\u201cTo be quite honest I don\u2019t even remember, though that\u2019s probably due to me losing the damn eye in the first place. I remember reaching my limit with the Empire towards the last days of the war. I mean we were supposed to be making peace with the Felkans, because we couldn\u2019t get our own shit together and we still had commanders throwing soldiers at the Felkan borders! What kind of logic is that? Anyway, at that point I just said fuck it and decided to leave. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure where I was going to go, and I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened soon after, but I\u2019m guessing I must\u2019ve crossed into Felkan territory or something, because the last thing I remember was a flash and everything went black. Guess I was so pre-occupied, I forgot to stay alert for traps. Next thing I knew, I woke up on a Felkan medic table. They said they found me and kept me alive, but couldn\u2019t save my eye. I still have memory problems about other parts of the past too, but nothing serious.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised they didn\u2019t kill you, or leave you to die instead.\u201d\n\u201cEh, the Felkans have always been a little odd that way. Their medics have some sort of code or something, but still here was a hated enemy and they were treating me a hell of a lot better than the Empire ever did. That\u2019s pretty much when I offered my services to them. Took a while for them to trust me, but eventually they did. Of course it helped later on I saved the lives of some royals, but that\u2019s a tale for another time. I think we need to get you started on your own new life here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I still feel a little odd about all this.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it, and in time you\u2019ll see that your efforts will be better appreciated here than they ever were in the Empire.

By the same token you\u2019re not going to pledge yourself to yet another government that will probably be just as corrupt and decadent as the one you just left. Maybe in a way, Kane was right. He was obviously suffering a mental breakdown as well as being manipulated, but the concept of forming your own nation would be the surest way to \u2018get it right.\u201d You could run things the way they SHOULD be.\n\nThe question is where to start? You\u2019d need at least an army to conquer anything and right now you don\u2019t really have that. You\u2019re sure you could probably get those \u201cnew eternals\u201d to follow you, but there still isn\u2019t enough of them even if you were inclined to subject yourself to the torture of futility. Regular soldiers would probably follow you, but nowadays they\u2019re so scattered that you\u2019d literally have to travel all over most of the Empire to collect them, not to mention all the fighting you\u2019d have to do during this state of anarchy.

It\u2019s virtually the one place still left in the empire that isn\u2019t suffering outright revolts, though the citizens are reportedly still severely disgruntled, Brenda is also there in command of Fort Glory. Perhaps she\u2019ll see the wisdom of your plan and help you, if that\u2019s the case you should be able to pull it off.\n\nYou find a nearby horse and set off for the south. Along the way you see the landscape of the Empire, which at one time was orderly and even idyllic is now burning and in tatters. Despite the chaos you don\u2019t need to do any battle, not even when passing groups of angry peasants who are taking every opportunity to get revenge on their oppressive government and its agents in all forms. You can only assume your reputation is enough to scare them off or they don\u2019t even recognize you. If it\u2019s the latter then it only confirms your belief that you weren\u2019t making that much of a difference in the Empire anyway.\n\nWhen you get to the Nalin province you find it in much better condition than the rest of the places in the Empire that you\u2019ve ridden through. Fort Glory looks slightly different, namely it looks more heavily fortified and a lot better cared for than when you left this place. When you approach Fort Glory, you are momentarily halted by the guards, but when you tell them who you are and that you need to see Brenda they immediately let you in.\n\nBrenda is very surprised to see you. She looks a lot different from the teenage girl you parted company with. Her hair is going gray and she has a very \u201ctired\u201d look about her.

Wow you haven\u2019t really changed at all.\u201d She says almost smiling.\n\u201cIt is good to see you too, Brenda. Still as pretty as ever.\u201d You say, unsure of how to respond.\n\u201cPretty? Now that\u2019s a word I never thought I\u2019d hear you say. Let alone to me. Maybe you have changed more than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cWell I mean I never thought you were ugly, Brenda. I was just trying to reply to your compliment with one of my own.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, a complete lack of tact. That\u2019s more like the old you. Still it\u2019s nice to hear, though I hope for your sake, you\u2019re a better sweet talker to the other girls out there.\u201d\n\u201cBrenda, I have to talk to you in private about something it\u2019s very important and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to react.\u201d You say by passing her statement.\n\u201cOh geez, you\u2019re not going to suddenly confess some sort of hidden love for me that you\u2019ve kept to yourself all these years are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! NO! This is something important!\u201d\n\nBrenda\u2019s a little amused by how you worded your statement especially since she was joking. You just aren\u2019t in a \u201cjoking mood\u201d though right now and after what you have to tell Brenda you doubt if she will too.\n\n\u201cLook, I apologize for my outburst. It\u2019s just that this is really important.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go to my office and speak privately there.\u201d\n\nWhen you get to Brenda\u2019s office you don\u2019t bother beating around the bush and you just tell her everything. Your thoughts, feelings, actions and ultimately your plan and why you came here. Now she really is amazed. You of all people were practically a paragon of duty and loyalty and here you are openly confessing that you\u2019ve abandoned the Empire.\n\n\u201cOkay, wow. Well you\u2019ve just been full of surprises today.\u201d\n\u201cWill you help me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly am I supposed to do? I mean are you seriously asking me to just hand over control of this fort to you while you play pretend emperor?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I mean shit I don\u2019t know I haven\u2019t thought out all the details yet I guess. It\u2019s just (sigh) Look Brenda, I just left ALL I\u2019ve known. Everything I\u2019ve ever been taught to believe in is GONE, if it ever existed to begin with. I didn\u2019t have many choices on what to do next and this seemed to be the best choice all things considered. I came here because I didn\u2019t know where else to go quite frankly. I see now that this was just as foolish an idea leaving the Empire in the first place, I guess\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat wasn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cLeaving the Empire. I mean I certainly understand your reasons. I share them. Maybe not in the exact same way, but they are there. Hell I think in these dark times, everyone shares them. I dunno perhaps you just made that extra step that the rest of us here aren\u2019t quite willing to make yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI mean everyone in this fort and probably the entire province would be for seceding from the Empire at this point. I think the only reason why nobody has done it yet or even rioted is due to way we run things here at Fort Glory. We found it much better by just letting people go about their business if we\u2019re not threatening them all the time and actually defending them from real external threats. The only real problem here is the high taxes which the Empire imposes on this region, that of course tends to make people a little grumpy, but not quite enough to riot. They remember what this place used to be like after all.\"\n\u201cNot threatening people you say? That\u2019s a pretty wild concept. Did you think that one up?\u201d\n\u201cNah, the credit goes to Roldan, he was the first to suggest it. He probably would\u2019ve made a better fort commander too and if he had been promoted instead of me, he might still be here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBrenda, okay you can\u2019t think like that. If he\u2019d been promoted then you\u2019d probably be dead and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. I just get a little sad thinking about him not being here sometimes. Okay, anyway let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s break away from the Empire. Like you said, shouldn\u2019t take much convincing, though I hope you\u2019re prepared for a shitstorm from this. We might not much problem from the population, as I said they\u2019ll probably be relieved to not have to pay the high taxes any more, but we\u2019re going to get Empire armies to come down here eventually.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly, but it\u2019s pretty bad Brenda. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll be able to really do anything, the government is on the brink of collapse. If anything we might be getting an influx of people wanting to come here to join. You\u2019re just lucky they didn\u2019t saddle you with those new eternals. If they had, I guarantee this place wouldn\u2019t be as nice as it is now.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. I suppose I am lucky. This whole province is lucky.\u201d\n\nBrenda takes a deep breathe before speaking again.\n\n\u201cOkay so how exactly are we doing this? I mean what system are we going to have in place?\u201d\n\u201cWell, given what you\u2019ve told me about how you\u2019ve been running things, I\u2019ve had one new idea. How about YOU run this place and you be the leader?\u201d\n\u201cME? But\u2026I don\u2019t know anything about running a nation or anything like that!\u201d\n\u201cSeems to me you\u2019ve been running this place pretty well for years. You know the people and better yet, they know you. I think if I was in charge\u2026well they\u2019d think they were living under the Empire again. No, I realize now my place isn\u2019t to rule, but to fight. It really is what I\u2019m good at. About the only thing.\u201d\n\u201cNow come on, you have great leadership skills!\u201d\n\u201cLeadership skills for combat perhaps, but not for ruling. I think whatever is it that you had with Roldan made you and him more in touch with human nature and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026it was a good thing. I just wish he was here. I could certainly use his help right now.\u201d Brenda says reminiscing.\n\nYou pat Brenda on the shoulder in your effort to comfort her; she tells you she\u2019s fine though. You and Brenda at that point set your plan in motion to split from the Empire.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Chapter 3A3: Remnant\n\n\nYear 45\n\nIn all the years you served the Empire, you always felt like you were being held back in some way; lack of supplies, lack of equipment, ungrateful rioting peasants, or incompetent commanding officers. In most cases it was never a failing on your part.\n\nFor the past few years, you\u2019ve come to appreciate no longer having any of those limitations. In Nalin everyone more or less works for the greater good of the country. In fact it could be argued that this is more the case here than it ever was in the Empire, at least as far as you saw. Brenda eventually declared the biggest town (Now a city) Dalt to be the capital and moved there to better manage things. You of course are head of the army and remained at Fort Glory.\n\nDespite her initial inexperience at running a nation, Brenda has proven to do a fair job at it. Hand picking town mayors and other bureaucratic types to help run things certainly helps. What also helps is Nalin is a much smaller nation than the Empire was. The long arm of the army doesn\u2019t need to go far to catch someone doing something against the law.\n\nYour intimidating reputation as head of the army obviously keeps people in line as well. Still, it isn\u2019t complete fear; they know you\u2019ll also keep them safe. When Usksha raiders started gathering around the southern borders again, you made sure to strike at them before they could attack any of the southern towns. You wish you could just go into the Usksha Desert and wipe them all out, but you know you just don\u2019t have the resources for such a thing. Still, you did find a temporary solution in the form of an equally old annoyance. The kobold tribes who eventually realized that continuing to fight against you would result in genocide, agreed to relocate to the edges of the southern Nalin border where they would help defend it. This has worked out quite well. The harsh terrain conditions closer to the desert as well as the occasional Usksha raids keep the kobold population down as well as aid as a front line defense without having to waste valuable troops.\n\nFor the most part everything has been running quite well, perhaps a little too well to the point where you get a little bored, but you don\u2019t even mind that now. You\u2019re just glad to be part of a nation that isn\u2019t crippled by corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is the last remnant of the true Empire.\u201d You sometimes think.\n\nOf course a certain person might disagree with that thought, namely Edgar.\n\nEdgar hasn\u2019t contacted you or Brenda. Brenda wonders if it\u2019s because he considers you both traitors for seceding from the Empire, and while that sounds like Edgar, you suspect it\u2019s more because he\u2019s been very busy. Ever since the Empire fell, Edgar has been busily trying to unite all the new \u201ceternals\u201d under his command and his results are quite surprising. He\u2019s not only managed to do it, but he\u2019s forged his own nation calling it the Eternal Dominion. He claims it is the successor to the Empire and as general he has vowed to reunite all the old lands by any means. So far he\u2019s had varying success, but he\u2019s doing well under the circumstances. He\u2019s also created a strict hierarchy system where Eternals are considered to be the superior ruling class and everyone else is below them. You aren\u2019t exactly sure what to make of this ideology.\n\nAssuming he\u2019s successful, you know it\u2019s only going to be a matter of time before Edgar comes marching an army from the north. Brenda has the same concerns and lately a majority of the military has been stationed on the northern borders. You just aren\u2019t sure it\u2019ll be enough. Brenda wonders if an alliance would be best, but the only other major power in the region is the Felkan Kingdom, and you\u2019re not exactly sure if they would even be in a position to help, let alone willing to help. The enemy of my enemy isn\u2019t always your friend.\n\nThis ties in with the other matter that has come up is expansion. Nalin has had a steadily growing population for quite some time and since the south is hostile desert, the western side of Nalin is covered by an equally imposing mountain range and to the north is old empire lands suffering from destroyed infrastructure and near anarchy, the only logical conclusion is to the east.\n\nSlowly over time Brenda has encouraged Nalin citizens to systematically settle the eastern wilderness. The Empire for some reason never colonized this territory. It probably was marked, but just never exploited due to other more pressing matters. In any case, things have gone more or less peacefully as there have been no encounters with any hostile natives and it has proven to be great farming land. While things are peaceful there now, there\u2019s no telling what could happen later and due to all the troops on the northern border, the eastern territory has a minimum number of soldiers there. Right now you and Brenda are discussing on how to best to maximize your defenses.\n\n\u201cHave you sent envoys to Edgar? Is it possible that he wouldn\u2019t be a problem in the future?\u201d you ask Brenda.\n\u201cI actually have a couple times over the years and none of them ever returned. Which is why I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s pissed at us.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, well guess we better up keep the defenses on the northern borders then. Still, my own reports say he\u2019s still nowhere near us. He\u2019s been trying to tame the core region of the old Empire as well as maintain order in places he\u2019s already conquered. There is the option to take redeploy some of the troops to the east.\u201d\n\u201cBut of course that would weaken us in the north.\u201d\n\u201cWell yes, but if you\u2019re really worried about the east, then that\u2019s all I can suggest other than conscription.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thought about that, and I\u2019m not exactly keen on that idea. The people have been happy for quite awhile. We start conscripting like the Empire did, they might not be as happy.\u201d Brenda says\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be even less happy, if Edgar comes barging down here declaring them all inferior while letting his Eternal troops run amok.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cWell I certainly would try my best to not let it happen, but let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not as certain about things as I once was, there is always the chance things can go horribly wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I understand that. (Sigh) Well, I suppose we can restart conscription. It\u2019s not going to be popular, but I think if we stress how much of a threat Edgar potentially is, we\u2019ll prevent the civil unrest. I\u2019ll get my civilian advisors to start spinning the propaganda. I\u2019ll leave it up to you how you want to deploy the troops; I think it would be best to put most of the conscripts on the east though, as I think we\u2019ll need most of the experienced troops on the northern borders.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll certainly consider all the options. I guess I\u2019ll get to it then and leave you to your work as well.\u201d You say and are about to leave when Brenda calls out to you.\n\u201cHey, I know you\u2019re very duty bound anyway, but I just want to say, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to help me.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m happy to help, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d do just as well without me here.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but it\u2019s sort of comforting to have another Eternal around to talk to. I just feel like we connect a lot better you know?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do agree. We do share a bond that most others will never know.\u201d\n\nBrenda goes to hug you and you\u2019re a little unsure of how to react at first, but you hug her back. Before you leave Brenda asks you one more question.\n\n\u201cDo you think Edgar\u2019s ideology for his nation is correct? Do you think Eternals are superior to everyone else?\u201d\n\nYou think about the question for a moment, then answer.\n\n\u201cI think Edgar thinks it is correct. In one aspect, I agree with it, I mean look at the pair of us. We\u2019re both in the highest positions of power and people seem to be accepting of it. However, from my own experiences with the new Eternals I\u2019m not actually convinced that THEY are superior to the average human except in combat and sadism which I suppose are good enough to instill fear into the masses.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, but isn\u2019t that what we do?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, but we do it because we know it\u2019s necessary to maintain order. The new Eternals engage in pointless cruelty because they enjoy it. They\u2019re no better than svelks in that regard. They\u2019re so eager to move on to next atrocity that they let their emotions cloud their purity of battle. I believe this is a weakness on their part and that is why I do not consider them superior.\u201d\n\nBrenda smiles a bit at your answer.\n\n\u201cThe Empire really should\u2019ve made you a general straight out of training. I\u2019m certain you would\u2019ve single handedly saved it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps it was beyond saving by that time. If you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d you say and leave Brenda\u2019s office.\n\nAs you leave the capital building, you think back on how you left the Empire. While you\u2019re satisfied with your decision, part of you does wonder IF you could\u2019ve done anything. Not just at that time, but before then. Is there another decision you could\u2019ve made that would\u2019ve prevented the situation you\u2019re in now?\n\nAfter a brief run down in your mind of endless possibilities you quickly dismiss such thoughts as a fool\u2019s game. You were right, the Empire was beyond any help you could\u2019ve provided. Nalin is your concern now and you need to make the decisions to how to best protect it starting with deciding where to send the conscripts when Brenda enacts her decree.", "action_results": [{"action": "Send them to the northern borders", "result": "As much of a threat Edgar could potentially be, he\u2019s not knocking down your door right now and as safe as the east seems to be, it\u2019s still mainly uncharted territory. Anything could be lurking over there. Best to have experienced troops there just in case, in fact you\u2019re going to have them make scouting expeditions.\n\nWhen Brenda enacts conscription there is a lot of grumbling as was expected, but nothing more. Many of the conscripts are a little nervous about being put on the northern borders after hearing all the scary things about Edgar and his \u201cbaby eating\u201d army. You make sure to keep enough vets there to keep them in line until they toughen up a bit more. You also make sure to keep a close eye on the situation.\n\nMonths pass a life goes on as usual, and you begin to get reports on the eastern wilderness. Most of the scouts say that there is evidence of other denizens living further east. In fact there seems to be a small tribal war going on between four separate groups. Two of those are human barbarian tribes, one them is elven, but much wilder than what you know of them and the last one is a race you\u2019re not familiar with called the Slin. They\u2019re apparently reptilian in nature though, similar to the kobolds, but much larger and meaner.\n\nAll of them save for one of the human tribes have been hostile to your scouts. Your scouts report that most attacks were accompanied by slurs and curses against the Empire. Even the Slin have been reported to utter a few recognizable insults in their strange reptilian tongue.\n\nYou can only guess that all of these folks at one time came in contact with the Empire and it wasn\u2019t a good experience. Makes sense they would mistake you for Empire troops as well considering that all your troops are either still wearing the same armor or very similar armor. Some of the really old guard are still wearing the same insignias. Sort of like you do actually.\n\nWhile you\u2019re confident that individually these uncivilized savage tribes wouldn\u2019t be a match in a straight up fight, there is always the possibility that they could all unite against you which would make things a little more difficult. They\u2019ve all most likely been living here a long time too, so they\u2019ll have the advantage of knowing the land better.\n\nRight now the situation is similar to the one you have with Edgar. They\u2019re all preoccupied fighting each other and not immediately close to any Nalin settlements. Stirring up a hornet\u2019s nest by marching east could bring that tribal alliance that you don\u2019t really want.\n\nThen again you have been getting sort of bored lately\u2026maybe you DO want it a little.\n\nYou make the decision and you\u2019re wiping out these troublesome tribes before they become a major problem. You\u2019re also going to personally lead this campaign of expansion; it\u2019s been far too long since you\u2019ve experienced a real battle again.\n\nBrenda is supportive of the idea, though she reminds you that if trouble comes to the northern borders she\u2019s going to have to pull everyone back immediately. Since that could happen at any time, you decide you need to handle this as quickly as you can, but at the same time, not sloppy.\n\nFirst thing you do is establish a sizable war camp near the closest Nalin village in the eastern wilderness. You then have your scouts contact the human tribe that wasn\u2019t hostile and to tell them that you want to meet their leader to discuss about destroying their enemies.\n\nYour scouts return with a crude map and report that the chieftain of the Belkaz Tribe is willing to listen, but that you must come meet him in his own village several miles away towards the southern hills and that if you arrive with more than five men he will consider you hostile and order an attack.\n\n\u201cAcceptable. I was going there by myself anyway.\u201d You say taking the map.\n\u201cSir?\u201d one of your scouts says after looking at the other in surprise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Corporal Bajin isn\u2019t it? You did your job. Take a break, and tell the rest that I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026don\u2019t you think you should take some of us with you? I mean they\u2019re barbarians and not exactly trustworthy.\u201d Bajin says.\n\u201cOh I know that, but if I can\u2019t handle a simple mission every once in awhile, well what kind of general am I? Relax, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d You say and gallop away on your horse towards the village.\n\nAs you get closer to your destination, you start noticing the usual primitive totems typical of such tribes establishing their territory. Eventually several barbarian types wrapped in furs and other crude cloth stop you.\n\n\u201cThis is Belkaz territory! You go back or die!\u201d one of them shouts as they all point spears at you.\n\u201cI have business with your chieftain. My scouts contacted some of your fellows about it not too long ago.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking amongst themselves for a moment, one addresses you again.\n\n\u201cYou must be leader of the Empire men to the west. Other tribes hate you. Scared of you. Very funny because you are not scary. Not even that big. But other tribes cowards, we not. Come with us and do not try anything!\u201d\n\nYou follow the Belkaz to their village which is a fairly large one. You assume that there are probably others, but that this is just their \u201ccapital.\u201d You get off your horse and look around and see the usual trappings of a primitive village. This whole situation is starting to remind you of your time in Rask. Though you hope that these particular barbarians aren\u2019t shapeshifters or spirits in disguise otherwise this idea of yours is not going to go well.\n\nThe Belkaz chieftain comes out of his hut. He\u2019s certainly a big muscular man. Almost ogre sized. Hell, he may even have ogre blood in him. Heavily tattooed, various tribal piercing. All proof of his manhood and tolerance to pain no doubt. A worn looking axe hangs by his side. Probably has seen a lot of battle. You figure he slaughtered his way to the top like most of his kind do. Whether it was enemies of the tribe or rivals within the tribe, it doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s proven himself to be the best warrior and that\u2019s what makes him the leader. The rest fall in line when he give them an order.\n\nHe stands before you looking down at you. Probably wondering how someone so small could be a leader of anything.\n\n\u201cHuh. Empire man. You wanted to discuss a possible alliance?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I wanted to discuss destroying your enemies.\u201d You say looking up.\n\u201cHrm? Yeah, I said alliance. You need help destroying other tribes.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I need help, but no I do not need an alliance.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak in riddles Empire man.\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies. Perhaps this is something you would better understand.\u201d You say and draw your sword.\n\nThe Belkaz immediately goes for his axe, but fails you draw it in time since you land a heavy blow on his forearm nearly chopping it completely off. He bellows in pain and falls back holding on to his dangling bloody limb. Two Belkaz attempt to spear you in the back, but you easily dispatch them with spinning swing to their bellies unleashing their innards all over the ground.\n\nYou run another Belkaz through as you advance towards the chieftain who has managed to draw his axe and recover from the initial shock of losing a vital limb which still partially dangles by the skin and bleeds profusely. He swings his axe recklessly at your head screaming the whole time. The battle was over long ago for him though as you easily duck such an attack and aim your sword directly at his groin. Literally destroying his manhood, his screams suddenly become much higher pitched as the useless member falls to the ground along with its two friends.\n\nDropping his axe, falling to his knees and attempting to hold himself up with his one good arm, you finish him off with a chop to his head, and then another, and then another until his head splits in two. Already dead at this point, you then stomp on his split skull crushing the brain matter leaking out.\n\nThe rest of the Belzak tribe at this point is either hiding or staring in awe of how easily you dispatch their leader. You look around and after catching your breath, you speak.\n\n\u201cThis man did not lead your tribe to victory against your enemies. As such he was also your enemy and needed to die. This will be your fate as well if you do not submit to my army. If you wish to live and see victory over your enemies, then you will join me. If not\u2026well you will join him.\u201d You say and point at their dead chieftain with your sword.\n\nYou get back on your horse unopposed and ride back to your camp where some of your soldiers have been mildly concerned about you. You address the camp and one of your lieutenants in particular.\n\n\u201cEveryone get some rest tonight our path to victory begins tomorrow. Lieutenant Harren I\u2019m going to need you to take a platoon and head out to the main Belzak village tomorrow. Be on guard, as usual, but I think you\u2019ll find the natives quite agreeable with helping you in any way they can. In fact I dare say after this is all over they\u2019ll be some of the most loyal of our newest citizens.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 46\n\nIt took longer than you expected, but you\u2019ve at last tracked down the main lair of the Slin. They\u2019ve stretched this little war out the longest, but this is where it\u2019s going to end.\n\nArrows unleashed by Slin bows hit some of your Belzak skimishers, but your own soldiers advance on the cave opening undeterred with their shields held up to protect them.\n\nYou shake your head when you see the remaining Belzak run away. They\u2019ve actually been completely useless when fighting the Slin. The only time they seemed to prove useful is when you were wiping out the Fleg tribe.\n\nThe Fleg were pretty odd as you came to find out that they were decedents of once regular Empire citizens that started believing in some weird cult that took hold in the Nalin province long before you were around. The Empire stomped it out, but obviously the remainder fled here. Surrender and backing down wasn\u2019t an option for them. When you got to their last village you found that they all committed ritual suicide. Their cult finally wiped out.\n\nYou and your men fight your way into the cave entrance, several large Slin come lumbering from various tunnels hissing and charging at you. You like that. You appreciate a foe that gives no quarter and doesn\u2019t run even in the face of certain death.\n\nIt\u2019s more than can be said of the wild elves. They were fierce fighters at first, but after you wiped out the Fleg and started making great progress against the Slin, something in them must\u2019ve changed. It\u2019s as if all their courage left them. Their elder came to you and begged you to spare them from genocide. These elves were all former slaves that managed to run away from the Empire long ago. The elder spoke of how he should\u2019ve known it was folly to run away and that eventually the Empire would eventually find them again even if it took them hundreds of years. You told him that the Empire was no more, but his peoples\u2019 attacks on your soldiers was something that couldn\u2019t be forgiven.\n\nTaking a page from Captain Krozer\u2019s handling of elves in Rask, you had all the adults and elderly killed. Any children were taken to become wards of the state. While slavery doesn\u2019t exist in Nalin as it did in the Empire, you figure these children can still be indoctrinated to be proper citizens and given a second chance at a better life. Sometimes mercy can be a good thing.\n\nSeveral Slin lie dead at your feet. More of them continue to pour in as you and your remaining men travel further into the cavern.\n\nNo, there will be no capitulation, or cowardly escape through suicide here. Before you killed the elven elder, he told you that the Slin apparently once lived in the Delerg swamps before being driven out by the Empire. (With the help of the Shadow Guard) Funny how all these people managed to settle in the same area and fight each other rather than unite, but then they all had different reasons and ways of life.\n\nThe Slin don\u2019t even realize that the Empire has fallen, and attempting to explain it to them at this point wouldn\u2019t do any good even if you wanted to bother with such a thing. You\u2019re close enough to being one of their oppressors in their eyes and your goals of kill or be killed were locked in as soon as you stepped into their territory\n\nThe final confrontation takes place in what you guess to be brood chamber. Even Slin children are vicious enough to take part in battle. The Slin matriarch isn\u2019t as big as the ones you\u2019ve been fighting, but she has the advantage of some sort of primitive magic. She casts a poisonous cloud causing several of your troops that had followed you, immediately gag, cough and vomit. They eventually succumb to the toxins and choking on their own blood and bleeding from every orifice. The cloud doesn\u2019t make you feel too well either, but being an Eternal you\u2019re made of stronger stuff and have natural immunities to most poisons.\nHer brood bite at your legs as you attempt to fight through the haze of the poison cloud. You slaughter all of them and ignore the pain of several teeth cutting through your leggings and into your flesh.\n\nThe matriarch hisses at you backing away as you advance towards her. She attempts to cast another spell, but you interrupt her by slashing her staff out of her hand. Lacking any other weapons, she resorts to her natural ones that are just as good to kill someone with. She lunges at you and wrestles you to the ground where you lose your sword in the process.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing and breathing due to the cloud, you begin to feel a lot weaker and you struggle to free your arms from her talons.\n\n\u201cBabies! Ssss! You kill my babiessss!\u201d She says attempting to bite your face off. You more your head in such a manner that she only manages to bite your ear off instead. At this time you finally manage to free one of your arms and bring a fist to the side of her head. It isn\u2019t enough to knock her off of you, but it\u2019s enough to daze her enough so you can free your other arm. With both hands free you take your thumbs and jam them into the red orbs of the matriarch succeeding in pulling one out completely.\n\nThe matriarch shrieks in pain holding her face and you push her off of you. Blind and crawling on the ground, she attempts to look for her staff. You stand up and easily grab your own weapon and put the matriarch out of her misery with a chop to her leathery neck. Another severs her head completely.\n\nYou stagger out of the Slin brood chamber coughing up some blood from all the poison you inhaled from the now dissipating cloud. Some of your troops that were still fighting Slin in other parts of the cavern see that you\u2019re not feeling your best and go to help you.\n\nYou don\u2019t remember exactly what happened after that. You must\u2019ve passed out briefly because the next thing you know you\u2019re lying outside the cave surrounded by some of your soldiers and a few of the belzaks who must\u2019ve regained their courage after they ran away. You\u2019re still not feeling good, who knows how much of that poison is in your system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this before! He needs certain herbs to cure the poison, and I have some, I can mix up an antidote right here!\u201d one of the belzak says.\n\u201cShut the fuck up tribal, you oughta be glad we\u2019re not executing you right now for desertion on the battle field! In fact let\u2019s take care of that right now!\u201d a soldier remarks and you hear a scuffle and protests of wanting to help and begging for life.\n\nYou struggle to get up, and you manage it just barely. You feel like you\u2019re going to collapse again and you aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re going to make it to the medic back at the war camp.\n\nIn the meantime the belzakians are begging you to call off you soldiers.", "action_results": [{"action": "Call off the execution", "result": "You\u2019re feeling so ill at this point that if these deserters can actually do something to help you, you\u2019ll give them a pass.\n\n\u201cRelease them\u2026let them make their antidote.\u201d You gasp.\n\nYour soldiers are hesitant, but fulfill your orders and release the belzakians so that they can do their work. The one who spoke up thanks you immediately and starts asking his buddies to help him mix up the antidote.\n\nYou lie on a bed roll drifting in and out of deliriousness hoping they hurry up with that antidote, eventually one of them approaches you.\n\n\u201cThis is for you, my merciful general!\u201d\n\nYou grab the wooden bowl that they\u2019ve mixed the antidote in and struggle to sit up. After gazing into the green liquid you drink deeply.\n\n\u201cYes, drink, soon all your pain will be no more!\u201d the belzak exclaims\n\nYou might be ill and your hearing might be off due to missing an ear now, but the tone of the belzak\u2019s voice is a little concerning. And you have every right to be concerned unfortunately it\u2019s a little too late.\n\nYour throat and your entire insides feel like they\u2019re on fire. If you were ill before, that \u201cantidote\u201d you just drank made it ten times worse. You struggle to breathe and attempt to grab at the belzak who avoids your feeble attempts, though your other soldiers grab him and his fellows.\n\n\u201cYES DIE TYRANT! DIE FOR MAKING MY TRIBE SLAVES!\u201d he screams before one of your soldiers cuts his throat.\n\nIt\u2019s no victory though; your own life ends soon after as the mixture of poisons in your system shut down your body completely.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Have them killed", "result": "\u201cKill these fucking deserters and get me to the medic.\u201d You say.\n\nThe screams of the belzak deserters begging for their lives and death squeals fall on deaf ears\u2026or rather ear as the case may be now.\n\nEventually you manage to make it to the medic who immediately starts administering an antidote to you. You\u2019re out of commission and very sick for a couple of days, but after which time you\u2019re at least able to stand without feeling ill anymore. Your chewed off ear isn\u2019t an excessive problem as you can still hear relatively well, still you do feel a sense of \u201closs.\u201d\n\nIn any event the expansionist eastern campaign is over. All the tribes have been either wiped out or subdued to the point of submissiveness. Brenda will be relieved to hear it, as you know she was always concerned about having most of the veteran troops there instead of the northern borders. She\u2019ll also be pleased that there weren\u2019t many losses overall.\n\nYou\u2019re satisfied with the results, though now you\u2019re just wondering what you\u2019re going to do with yourself again.\n\nYear 50\n\n\u201cOur defenses are strong in the north. Have been for years. No need to be concerned about that.\u201d You say.\n\u201cI know, but this is a big thing. I mean after all these years now Edgar wants to speak with us?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cMy reports say he\u2019s gotten a lot more organized and isn\u2019t dealing with anarchy in his ranks anymore. He even re-conquered the old core lands of the Empire. It could be that he wants to see how strong we really are. His message said he\u2019s coming alone without anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s a good sign. Maybe he just wants to talk.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe he wants to kill us both to a great show of strength so Nalin will capitulate with minimum fuss.\u201d You point out.\n\u201cYeah\u2026there is that tactic. (sigh) Well I guess we all knew this day was coming. Guess I better practice my combat skills., which sadly have probably declined from lack of use. Would you spar with me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not that out of practice.\u201d You remark.\n\nYou and Brenda go to her personal training room where you and her prepare to spar. Brenda makes a few remarks about this being like the old days when Mistress made you fight each other. Brenda mentions the time when you broke Gerald\u2019s arm and Kane\u2019s nose when she pit them both against you.\n\n\u201cYeah, I remember that. That was my first match. Mistress had it in for me after I begged for my life. I was always pretty aggressive after that, well at least until Gruz told me I should master my anger better, and I did\u2026anyway let\u2019s get on with this.\u201d You say not really wanting to think about those days or any of the names mentioned.\n\nBrenda isn\u2019t quite as skilled as you remember her to be and she has indeed let her talents decline. Then again as you remember she always was more skilled with the bow. Something you never quite got the hang of yourself. You begin to get more in a \u201cdrill instructor mode\u201d and shout commands at her to watch her techniques.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I told you I was out of practice.\u201d She shouts back.\n\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t have let it get this bad in the first place.\u201d You say.\n\nAfter this remark, Brenda begins to get a little annoyed, which of course means she makes even more mistakes.\n\n\u201cBrenda, come on I know you\u2019re better than this! Focus!\u201d\n\u201cI am!\u201d\n\u201cWell prove it!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not the fucking lord of war that you are!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be me, you just need to be an Eternal!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell for? The Empire is fucking dead and we\u2019ve just been upkeeping a parody of it for the past fifteen years! I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing trying to run this fucking country anymore! I never wanted this! I\u2026I just wanted\u2026to spend the rest of my\u2026(sob) life with Roldan\u2026(sob)\u201d\n\nAt this point Brenda sits down on the floor and completely breaks down in tears. You can honestly say you weren\u2019t expecting this.\n\n\u201cBrenda\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t be the Eternal you are. I can\u2019t even be the Eternal that Edgar is. I lost that edge when I fell in love. I wasn\u2019t supposed to and neither was Roldan! If we hadn\u2019t been so weak, he\u2019d still be alive and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDammit Brenda, you can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for his death! Your relationship and whatever feelings you had for each other had nothing to do with some insane asshole blowing him up. What\u2019s bringing this all on? Edgar? I think you\u2019re worrying about him more than you need to. I mean for all we know he just wants play catch up and even if he doesn\u2019t we\u2019re going to be ready for him and his army of half assed Eternals\u2026\u201d\n\nBrenda shakes her head and tries to compose herself.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not Edgar. It\u2019s you.\u201d\n\u201cMe? What do you mean? Out with it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I think I\u2019ve developed the same kind of feelings for you that I did for Roldan.\u201d Brenda says.\n\nAnother surprise for you today, not exactly the best timing with all that\u2019s coming up soon.\n\n\u201c\u2026Uh\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026I guess\u2026I mean\u2026are you sure?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI think I\u2019d know. It\u2019s been building up slowly over time. At first I was just happy to have you around, another Eternal to talk to. Sure you weren\u2019t Roldan, and you\u2019re certainly less fun loving than he could be, but there was that familiar bond. Then when you were so instrumental in helping to keep order in this place, I remembered why we all admired and respected you as a leader so much back in the day. It also began to remind me of how Roldan and I complimented each other in keeping order here during the days of the Empire. You were bringing the memories of those good old days back and making them reality again.\u201d\n\u201cYou probably just still miss him and are transferring those feelings.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so too, which is why I didn\u2019t do anything before. In fact I was feeling guilty about it, I thought I was dishonoring Roldan\u2019s memory. Wasn\u2019t until I heard about your close call with death during your campaign in the east that I knew it was more than mere transference. I was so happy that you were still alive, I nearly told you how I felt when you came back. I just didn\u2019t think you suffered from such weaknesses and I wanted to remain strong because your respect was more important than my silly attractions.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have much experience with any of this, but you need to say or do something make Brenda feel better.\n\n\u201cBrenda, you\u2019ll always have my respect. As for anything between us, I never thought about it because I figured you\u2019d always be carrying a torch for Roldan. I\u2019m not opposed to the idea however. I mean we do have much in common and contrary to popular belief, I\u2019m not quite the unfeeling golem that most consider me to be. I do have feelings, even if I don\u2019t show them a lot and I would\u2019ve thought you knew that.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do, but you\u2019re in control of them or you at least direct them better. I worry that if by some chance something would to occur between us, that you would lose your edge. I don\u2019t want you to become weaker or distracted because of me. You\u2019re needed as you are now.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re about to reply, and then there\u2019s a knock on the door.\n\n\u201cSorry to disturb your training, but I\u2019ve been told that the leader of the Eternal Dominion has been spotted at the northern border. He\u2019s on a horse by himself, and several soldiers are already escorting him to Fort Glory. Did you want to meet him there or did you want us to escort him all the way to the capital?\u201d a voice asks from behind the door.\n\nThe pair of you didn\u2019t expect him this soon, let alone be in the middle of the discussion you\u2019re having now. You\u2019d probably both like to wrap this up before having to focus on Edgar, though the question is if you\u2019d have enough time to do it anyway.", "action_results": [{"action": "Meet Edgar at the fort", "result": "You and Brenda might have a bit more on your mind now, but this is much more important.\n\n\u201cBrenda, I know emotions are running high right now, but I think we need to go meet Edgar. We can talk more about this later.\u201d You say.\n\u201cYes. Yes, of course. We need to get back to business. I\u2019ll be okay. This was silly anyway. Need to focus.\u201d Brenda says standing back up and wiping her eyes.\n\nYou and Brenda ride off to Fort Glory. The ride there is done with minimal talking, but that\u2019s sort of to be expected. The thing is you never seriously thought about Brenda in that way until she just brought it up today. Sure you always knew you had that bond from both of you being Eternals and the fact that you\u2019ve served together for so long. You may have even had the occasional sexual thought about her, but like you said to her, you always figured she would\u2019ve carried a torch for Roldan. You would\u2019ve just been a substitute at best.\n\nNow you\u2019re having scenarios in your head about the two of you being together in a closer way and you really shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that at this moment. Maybe she\u2019s right in a way maybe if you did have something together it would cause you to lose your edge. It\u2019s certainly clouding your judgment right now and you\u2019re not even together.\n\nWhen you get to Fort Glory you\u2019re told that Edgar is waiting for you in your meeting room. When you ask how he seems, the soldiers say he\u2019s been stand offish, but not overly hostile. About what you expected.\n\nWhen you and Brenda reach the meeting room, you ask her if she\u2019s ready, and she remarks that she is. The door opens and you both step in and see Edgar sitting in a chair with a big grin on his face. He stands up and addresses the both of you.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s about time! I\u2019ve missed the both of you! Come here!\u201d he says jovially with his arms out walking towards you.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah, hey Edgar. Good to see you too.\u201d Brenda says when he gives her a big hug.\n\nLooks like it\u2019s going to be a day of surprises\u2026\n\nEdgar stops hugging Brenda and then looks at you. You stand a little back from him as you don\u2019t want to be hugged, but Edgar doesn\u2019t try it.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re the serious minded Bane of Rask! Bane of Nalin too now I hear! Heh, but how are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Edgar.\u201d You say.\n\u201cGood, good. I just have to say it\u2019s really great seeing the both of you again! I mean you two are like my brother and sister! No, you ARE my brother and sister!\u201d\n\nThe last time you heard this sort of sibling talk before was from Kane and if you weren\u2019t wary before, you certainly are now.\n\n\u201cEdgar, I\u2019m glad you seem to be in a good mood and all, but I sent envoys to contact you several times in the past and none of them ever returned. We always assumed you had them killed and were angry at us.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cYou did? When was the last one?\u201d\n\u201cMmm, last one was about six years ago I believe. After that, I saw no need to waste lives.\u201d\n\u201cAw! You should\u2019ve kept sending them! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware of just how much anarchy and infighting I\u2019ve had to put up with! Those envoys probably got killed by the new Eternals and nobody ever told me about it! Hell, they might\u2019ve even gotten killed by run of the mill bandits, it was pretty lawless back in the early days! Shit, if I had known you guys weren\u2019t pissed at ME, I would\u2019ve made this trek sooner!\u201d\n\u201cWait, so you weren\u2019t mad at us?\u201d\n\u201cMad at you guys? What the hell for?! Oh you mean seceding from the Empire? Well I have to say I was more shocked than angry about that. I mean YOU especially.\u201d Edgar says pointing at you. \u201cBut in time I heard about what you two were doing down here and I respected what the pair of you were attempting to do.\u201d\n\nYou and Brenda look at each other, wondering what Edgar THINKS you both were trying to do.\n\n\u201cOh? And what was that exactly?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cYou saw that the Empire was a lost cause, but you were trying to uphold a portion of it, though this patch of territory. I\u2019ve heard about your great success in keeping order and how you\u2019ve even added more land to your nation. Only an Eternal could do something like that and that\u2019s why both of you were successful!\u201d\n\nEdgar isn\u2019t far off, at least from your perspective. Though he probably has a more idealistic vision of it than the reality, which was this; you didn\u2019t know where else to go and over time Nalin was transformed into a \u201cmini Empire\u201d because you didn\u2019t know any other way. Brenda\u2019s reasons are probably based on simple emotional attachment.\n\n\u201cWell, we were doing the best we could under the circumstances, but you forged a whole new nation, so you\u2019ve been successful too Edgar.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cAh yes, but it wasn\u2019t easy! There were many times I almost wanted to give up and come join you two! But I knew I couldn\u2019t do that, I had a vision that I had to make work! A nation run by Eternals and I\u2019m proud to say it\u2019s all finally coming together and I think it\u2019s finally time for us, to reunite like we were meant to!\u201d\n\nYou and Brenda look at each other again.\n\n\u201cEdgar, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as simple as all that. We\u2019re going to have to discuss this, all of it.\u201d Brenda remarks and the three of you sit down to do just that.\n\nEdgar starts off by saying that while he respects what you\u2019ve done, he doesn\u2019t think that you\u2019re going about things the right way and that you\u2019re still thinking like \u201cThe Empire\u201d and clinging to the old way of doing things. He points out that within his new regime he\u2019s pushed for advances in weapon technology like the Felkan Kingdom has and managed to even \u201cacquire\u201d such gunpowder based weapons. He\u2019s also managed to get a few mages to help in getting the Eternal process started again.\n\nWhen you bring up your experience with the new Eternals, Edgar reassures you that they don\u2019t have the discipline issues at all anymore. He says he\u2019s manages to instill the pride of being an Eternal into them and they\u2019ve shaped up enough to no longer behave like the bloodthirsty children you knew them to be. He also says the next generation of Eternals are almost ready to prove their worth now as well and says he has made sure that their training was stricter and more in line with how you were trained.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see I\u2019m creating a new nation like the Empire, but how it should\u2019ve been run! A nation run by us Eternals! Only we are able to efficiently run things. The lessers can either wisely listen to us, or be crushed underfoot.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds very nice Edgar, but what is our place in this new nation?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d be helping of course! I mean we would be ruling as\u2026uh\u2026a council! Yes! A council of three! The Eternal Council!\u201d\n\u201cA council huh? Don\u2019t you think that might ruin your standing with the new eternals who you\u2019ve probably conditioned to listen to a single strong leader?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll still listen to me, because if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll get executed!\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026you\u2019d actually be in charge then.\u201d\n\u201cWell yes. I mean no. I mean\u2026fuck, why are you fighting me on this!? I just want us to all work together again like we should\u2019ve been doing a long time ago!\u201d Edgar says in an exasperated tone. He\u2019s actually getting upset. You\u2019re not really being a dick on purpose, but you have a lot of reservations about this plan Edgar has, even if he has genuine good intentions.\n\nBrenda has been fairly silent for a while, but she suddenly stands up and says to Edgar that she needs to speak to you outside. He says okay, but is obviously troubled by how this is going.\n\nBrenda and you leave and after dismissing the soldiers standing outside, you\u2019re standing in an empty corridor.\n\n\u201cI think we should join Edgar.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cWhat? Just like that? You\u2019d be giving up control of your own nation. Don\u2019t you have some concerns?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. I think you heard me say not too long ago, that I never wanted it. And you heard him, it sounds like Edgar\u2019s done a good job so far and just wants our help.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure if I want to. I know he claims to have those second generation Eternals under control, but I just don\u2019t trust them. And now he\u2019s saying there\u2019s a whole new batch to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can handle it, that\u2019s probably why he wants us to help. Besides, we\u2019d be with others of our kind at least; don\u2019t you wish for that sometimes? To not constantly be alone?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe my experiences are different, but not particularly. Besides, you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d\n\nThere is an uncomfortable silence with that statement. The unresolved issue between the pair of you has reared its ugly head again.\n\n\u201cI know, but I still have conflicting feelings about you and if we don\u2019t join Edgar he\u2019s going to declare war on us. Can we truly have any sort of meaningful relationship then? Would you become less focused with me on the back of your mind? If we join Edgar, the pressure to constantly run things would be off of us. We would have time to explore the potential for a deeper relationship. Look, I know your feelings on the new Eternals, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that. You\u2019re in charge here at least in the military aspect of things, which quite frankly is the only thing that does matter to you. You don\u2019t want to give that up and I understand, but I think you need to look at the bigger picture here.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Join Edgar", "result": "Maybe Brenda\u2019s got a point; maybe you need to let go of your control a bit. Edgar has certainly proven to be a more capable leader than when you last knew him, and he seems to genuinely want you and Brenda to have an equal partnership. You\u2019re still a little skeptical of that, but you\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\nThere\u2019s also your unresolved situation with Brenda. She has feelings for you and you realize you do have them for her. If there is the potential for something deeper here, maybe it would be better if the pressures of potential war with the Eternal Dominion were eliminated. Plus she wants to join, and you feel as if trusting in her judgment would be a positive step in your relationship.\n\n\u201cOkay Brenda. I agree. Let\u2019s join the Eternal Dominion.\u201d You say.\n\nBrenda smiles and gives you a hug added with a kiss, which startles you a little. You both very nearly make out in the hallway, but then you remember Edgar is still waiting for you.\n\nYou and Brenda return to the room where Edgar looks a bit on edge. You decide to let Brenda break the news to him.\n\n\u201cEdgar, we\u2019ve talked it over and we accept your offer.\u201d\n\nEdgar looks incredibly relieved and leaps out of his seat to shake both of your hands.\n\n\u201cGreat! That\u2019s great! Whew! For a moment I thought you weren\u2019t going to go for it, but I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d see the wisdom in this! This is going to be the best thing for all of us! You\u2019ll see!\u201d\n\u201cYou realize, there\u2019s going to be a lot of things to sort out Edgar.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh yeah! I know we\u2019ll hammer out the details and we\u2019ll be equals in this. You don\u2019t know what this means to me! The rest of our family united again, nothing can stop us! Not even that traitor Warrick!\u201d\n\u201cWarrick?\u201d you and Brenda ask in unison.\n\u201cYeah, he joined the Felkan Kingdom didn\u2019t you know? He joined a former enemy of the Empire! I guess you two probably wouldn\u2019t know being so far away from it and all. Oh well, doesn\u2019t matter we\u2019ll take him down like with did with Kane! Eh? Remember that?\u201d Edgar says nudging you.\n\u201cYeah I remember Edgar.\u201d You reply.\n\nEdgar is so happy right now, you think he\u2019s almost about to cry. It\u2019s definitely not a side you\u2019ve ever seen of him before.\n\n\u201cAh, well I wish I could stick around longer to celebrate, but I have to return. Got some things to take care of and prepare before the great merging of our territories! But we\u2019ll be seeing a lot of each other soon enough!\u201d\n\nEdgar leaves in good spirits and biding you both goodbye. As you and Brenda see him ride off, you shake your head in almost disbelief after all that\u2019s happened today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an overly emotionally day for you today I imagine.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not joking. I guess I am an emotionless golem compared to the rest of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t say that. You handled everything very well, for a golem.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. I just hope this is the right decision.\u201d\n\u201cYou still think you and Edgar will clash?\u201d\n\u201cAfter today, it\u2019s not really Edgar that I\u2019m concerned about, there\u2019s still all those newer generation of Eternals to deal with. I hope Edgar really does have them under control.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine. Odd news about Warrick though, thought he was dead.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that was just one of the many surprises today.\u201d\n\u201cWell enough about them, I think we\u2019ve got us to discuss.\u201d\n\nYou and Brenda retire to your quarters at Fort Glory. After an hour or so of talking, you both decide that it\u2019s time to take it to the more physical side of things. The night of passion you spend with Brenda is just one of many you hope in the years to come.\n\nYear 53\n\nYou and Brenda now oversee the Nalin territory as a married couple. The transition hasn\u2019t been a completely easy one, there was a lot of outright dissent when the announcement that Nalin was going to be annexed by the Eternal Dominion. Many of the citizens saw you and Brenda as their protectors against the ED, and then you went and joined it, and they had no say in the matter.\n\nMultiple rebellions had to be put down, Edgar wanted to send in Eternals to take care of the problem, but you and Brenda disagreed with that idea as it would just reinforce the fears of the less rebellious population. You instead resorted to more traditional means using normal Nalin troops, though your soldiers weren\u2019t exactly happy about it as they felt betrayed as well.\n\nWhile things in Nalin eventually settled down, the area feels like it could erupt with another rebellion at any time. You and Brenda haven\u2019t really been able to enjoy your newfound relationship with all the problems cropping up, though you do make the time when you can.\n\nIn the meantime Edgar has suggested that you and Brenda move into the royal palace and live there instead. He\u2019s wanted you to do that for some time. He\u2019s also been hinting and letting the Eternals go in and reinforce law and order at Nalin once and for all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already joined the Eternal Dominion why not leave and live in the palace? It is the capital after all and we are partial rulers.\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s still problems here and I\u2019d like to fix them before traipsing off to some cushy palace.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just stalling. We\u2019ve done the best we can to get this place to assimilate, and at this point it really would be for the best to let the Eternals come in and maintain the order now. We\u2019ve moved beyond this, and we deserve spending some downtime together. Besides, I would\u2019ve at least thought you\u2019d want to talk with Edgar about his battle plans to invade the Felkan Kingdom. Best way you can do that is to be at the palace.\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2026ah shit. You\u2019re right. I am stalling. It\u2019s still hard to let go of personally managing this place I suppose. There\u2019s also the fact that I still don\u2019t like the idea of having to deal with those second gen Eternals on a daily basis.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve spoken with some of them when we visited the palace before. They all seem pretty respectful.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cYeah, I suppose, I dunno\u2026okay let\u2019s move to the palace. I suppose we do deserve the break of living on the edge of dirty peasants possibly storming the gates.\u201d\n\nBrenda moves closer and hugs you in a loving way and kisses you. Despite all the shit you\u2019ve had to deal with concerning Nalin, you\u2019ve never felt happier than you have with Brenda. It is still weird to you that you can even feel this way. You never thought it was possible to feel so comfortable with another person on this sort of level, not even with another Eternal. Brenda has a way about her that manages to make you feel like everything is going to be okay. Safe even.\n\nYou and Brenda send word to Edgar that you\u2019re both making your preparations to move and he sends a letter back stating how pleased he is and will send one of his personal royal carriages to come pick you. You accept, what the hell, why not ride in needless luxury?\n\nYou both pack what you can and intend on sending for the rest of your things later. The pair of you board the carriage when it arrives and settle in for a long ride.\n\n\u201cSee, told you the new Eternals respect us, you saw how polite our drivers are.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cWell these ones seem to be anyway. But I have been thinking more about it and I\u2019m starting to accept the idea of making this change. I\u2019ve been thinking of some ideas about Edgar\u2019s plans for the Felkan Kingdom invasion.\u201d\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d see a bright side to it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s going to need my direct help on that plan. I\u2019m just glad I managed to talk him out of invading Rask. That would\u2019ve been a disaster.\u201d\n\nYou excitedly tell Brenda what you plan to tell Edgar for the Felkan Kingdom invasion, and she listens intently, but also gives her own input on some things. You take some of her ideas into consideration and generally enjoy this time you have. Later the pair of you begin to drift off together, not exactly the easiest thing to do in a carriage, but you\u2019ve always been a light sleeper any way.\n\nTimes passes and then suddenly\u2026\n\n\u201cSHIT! ATTACK!\u201d you hear one of the Eternal drivers shout followed by the sound of a pistol shot.\n\nYou instantly wake up and Brenda does likewise. You look out the window on your side and see several people armed with bows firing at the carriage. You then hear a loud crash that sounds like it came from in front of you, then the carriage screeches to a halt. The sounds of dying whinnies of horses soon follow.\n\nYou grab your own flintlock and fire off a shot from inside the carriage; Brenda meanwhile loads up her bow and fires off arrows from her side. You can hear the two Eternal drivers jumping off and yelling about getting to cover and closing the gap on these attackers. That\u2019s exactly what you had in mind; you never did get the hang of these gunpowder weapons.\n\nYou step out of the carriage and head for the nearest tree to get some cover. You look over at the other two Eternals ducked behind a large rock and motion them to run around the other way to help Brenda, They seem to understand.\n\nIn the meantime you manage to dodge arrows by ducking tree to tree and when you finally close the gap, you cleave one of your attackers\u2019 heads clean off. The rest of them draw their own swords and axes to attack, but in close combat it\u2019s no contest. You dispatch all of them with ease. They don\u2019t appear to be the unwashed rabble you\u2019ve been pissing off lately, they\u2019re too well armed and armored. You doubt if they\u2019re simple bandits either. These are probably mercenaries, but you don\u2019t have time to figure out right now who hired them, you turn around to go help Brenda.\n\nBy the time you get to the half destroyed carriage again, you don\u2019t hear anymore sounds of battle. When you see the Brenda\u2019s side of the carriage has been opened and some blood stain you begin to worry. Running over to the other side, you see several bodies of the attackers and then a few feet away, you see Brenda lying face down on the ground. Your heart sinks.\n\nYou run over to her and turn her over and your worst fears are confirmed, her eyes show no signs of life. Your eyes begin to water and a mixture of rage and sorrow causes you to cry out. As you hold her body you don\u2019t see any arrow or sword wounds, you do notice two gunshots to her chest though\u2026\n\nUpon the realization of who killed your beloved Brenda, you don\u2019t even get to face the treacherous dogs. The two Eternal drivers blast you from afar, one shot to your back and one to your head, killing you instantly.\n\nYour deaths are blamed on an ambush by some of the disgruntled population of Nalin. To his credit, Edgar doesn\u2019t believe the story and has the two Eternals executed for suspicion and incompetence.\n\nIt\u2019s of minor consequence though, the real conspirators of this assassination remain uncaught and you\u2019re still dead.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Don't join Edgar", "result": "Brenda\u2019s argument that you don\u2019t want to give up a lot of your autonomy is correct in many ways. Perhaps you are a little stuck in the past as well. You still remember having to save Edgar\u2019s life on more than one occasion. The idea of him telling you what to do is something that just doesn\u2019t sit right with you, even if you have put away your differences with him a long time ago. His council idea, while a valiant attempt is doomed to failure. Ultimately there can only be one real leader and while you don\u2019t mind following Brenda, you are not going to follow Edgar. The moment you disagree with him on something major it\u2019s going to get ugly again.\n\n\u201cBrenda I understand that you\u2019re officially in charge of Nalin so ultimately it is your decision, but call it pride or even a hunch, but I feel that joining with Edgar would only lead to bad things occurring. What we control now is stable and with minimal chaos, maybe it isn\u2019t the Empire or even the Eternal Dominion, but it is ours. If Edgar declares war on us for not joining, then so be it. At least that tells us where we always stood with him in the first place. And as for us, well if there is anything at all between us, then that relationship won\u2019t be effected whether we\u2019re at war with Edgar or not, so you shouldn\u2019t even let that cloud your judgment on this matter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if I decided that we should join with the Eternal Dominion? Would you leave?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cHonestly I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do\u2026(sigh) I suppose I\u2019d support your decision even though I didn\u2019t agree with it. Where that would leave us as far as a relationship is concerned, well as I said before, if there is anything genuine and meant to be there, then it\u2019ll survive it. Wouldn\u2019t change my feelings for you.\u201d\n\nBrenda smiles at your remark. The first you\u2019ve seen her do so all day. She then approaches and kisses you and you embrace her. You then both remember you\u2019ve got Edgar waiting for an answer.\n\nYou and Brenda return to the room where Edgar looks a bit on edge. You decide to let Brenda break the news to him.\n\n\u201cEdgar, I\u2019m sorry, but we both feel that Nalin should remain independent of the Eternal Dominion at this time.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026but you\u2019ve seen everything I\u2019ve done! I\u2019ve done all this for us! Eternals! Don\u2019t you see that?!\u201d Edgar says in an aspirated tone.\n\u201cWe\u2026know you did and we appreciate it, but I think our path is different from yours.\u201d Brenda says and then looks at you. Edgar notices this and tries a different tactic.\n\u201cOh wait. You two are together now? Well that\u2019s great! I mean I wasn\u2019t aware of it, but that\u2019s great! You weren\u2019t worried I was going to try anything did you? Ha ha, I\u2019ve got tons of concubines! I wouldn\u2019t dream of coming between you two! Heh, so if that was your only concern, you can join me and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo Edgar, it\u2019s not that. We\u2019re just happy with the way things are, but thank you all the same.\u201d Brenda says.\n\nAnd here it comes. Edgar\u2019s face changes to red and he begins breathing heavier.\n\n\u201cHAPPY? How the fuck can you two be so damn happy living in such mediocrity?! You\u2019re fucking Eternals! We\u2019re supposed to be ruling the fucking world! You two are no better than that traitor Warrick!\u201d\n\u201cWarrick?\u201d you and Brenda ask in unison.\n\u201cYeah, he joined the Felkan Kingdom didn\u2019t you know? He joined a former enemy of the Empire! Of course you two probably haven\u2019t been keeping up on events since you\u2019ve been playing grab ass with each other for the past fifteen years! By the Emperor\u2019s dead cock, you didn\u2019t wait long for Roldan to be dead did you?\u201d\n\nThis remark causes Brenda\u2019s calm demeanor to shift entirely and she stands up and draws her weapon.\n\n\u201cYou say one more fucking thing about my dead husband, and I\u2019ll send you back to the Eternal Dominion in fucking pieces!\u201d\n\nEdgar draws his own weapon, but was a little surprised by her response. It\u2019s all you can do to hold Brenda back.\n\n\u201cAlright, I think\u2026\u201d you start to say before Edgar cuts you off.\n\n\u201cAnd you! What the fuck happened to you? You were supposed to be the BEST of us! You were the one that was the leader! Now look at you! You\u2019re following Brenda because she\u2019s spread her legs for you? Where the hell are your balls? You know when we were young I disliked you a lot, but I always respected you. After our escape from Fort Defiance I liked you as well as respected you. Now? I can\u2019t say I feel either.\u201d\n\u201cOkay Edgar\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOut of all of us YOU were the one that was supposed to prevent the Empire from falling! What did you do? You ran away! You know what I did? I stayed until the bitter end picking up the pieces! I saw the fucking capital in flames! I tried so hard to prevent it\u2026I tried\u2026and you didn\u2019t help me, (sob) none of you did\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point Edgar collapses back in his seat sobbing and going on about how he failed. His motivations for everything he\u2019s done are a little clearer now. Even after the verbal abuse he laid down on Brenda, she sees now he probably didn\u2019t mean any of it.\n\nAfter all these years, Edgar is still like a teenager trying to prove himself by over compensating. You actually feel sorry for him. You can only imagine the internal torment he\u2019s been going through all these years since the Empire fell. Justifications, rationalizations, outright blocking out reality, he\u2019s probably done it all.\n\nYou sit down next to Edgar and pat him on the back.\n\n\u201cEdgar. There was nothing any of us could\u2019ve done. It was a doomed mission to begin with. You did your best and that\u2019s all anyone could\u2019ve done. Even an Eternal.\u201d\n\nEdgar tries to compose himself while you give your pep talk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve accomplished much and you should be proud of your achievements on their own merits, not as compensation for perceived failings. This is your path and your destiny. Brenda and I, we have our own path.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026okay\u2026\u201d Edgar sniffles.\n\nBefore he leaves he apologizes to Brenda and says he has no intention on invading Nalin, but he still hopes that one day you\u2019ll reconsider in joining him\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Perhaps one day our paths will reunite.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cI hope that day will be soon, goodbye my Eternal brother.\u201d Has says extending his hand.\n\u201cGoodbye Edgar.\u201d You reply and shake his hand.\n\nAfter Edgar leaves the fort you sit down and run your hands over your face and taking a deep breath from all the emotional baggage you had to put up with today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an overly emotionally day for you today I imagine.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not joking. I guess I am an emotionless golem compared to the rest of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t say that. You handled everything very well, for a golem.\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Well anyway that\u2019s one less thing to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think we shouldn\u2019t still be concerned about him? I mean I know he said he wouldn\u2019t invade, but there\u2019s always the possibility of a sneak attack.\u201d\n\u201cEdgar\u2019s a lot of things, but he not a backstabber. At least he wouldn\u2019t be for us. If he ever does decide to do it, I promise you, it\u2019ll be announced in a very dramatic fashion weeks in advance.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019re right. Odd news about Warrick though, thought he was dead.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that was just one of the many surprises today. But I guess that was his path and how he dealt with the fall. It\u2019s all in the past now anyway, I\u2019m not going to judge him.\u201d\n\u201cWell enough about them, I think we\u2019ve got us to discuss.\u201d\n\nYou and Brenda retire to your quarters at Fort Glory. After an hour or so of talking, you both decide that it\u2019s time to take it to the more physical side of things. The night of passion you spend with Brenda is just one of many in the years to come.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 55\n\nYou and Brenda now rule the nation of Nalin as a married couple. There has been some issue on what your official titles are now. The simplest choices would be emperor and empress or king and queen. Eventually Brenda settled for imperatrix, which would officially make you imperator, though you still go by general for the most part.\n\nIn any case life has been good. You don\u2019t even mind that things have been slow since you conquered all those tribals in the east. You\u2019ve been taking a slightly more active role in running the nation from an administrative point of view, but sometimes you still long for the day of a good battle. When that day comes you\u2019ve also tried to keep up on the changing times of changing warfare. While the days of close combat are far from over, if the Eternal Dominion is starting to slowly incorporate firearms into their ranks, then you better do likewise if only to maintain a show of strength.\n\nThe ED isn\u2019t hostile though and you maintain a good trading relationship with them. Edgar still hopes you\u2019re going to join him one day, especially since you know he\u2019s got designs on going to war with the Felkan Kingdom (You gave him some friendly advice to not bother with invading Rask).\n\nHe\u2019d probably like you to at least be involved in a joint military operation with him, but you think he\u2019s over extending himself and the Felkan Kingdom is no pushover. It\u2019s not exactly like you\u2019re near the Felkan Kingdom as far as location is concerned either. All you\u2019d be doing is having soldiers die in a war that doesn\u2019t even directly benefit your nation.\n\nThat being said, Nalin hasn\u2019t sided with the Felkan Kingdom either in any way. Again, due to your location, you\u2019ve had minimal contact with them. Brenda thought about allying with them in the past, but that was never seriously considered (Good thing too). Somehow though you imagine you\u2019re going to get dragged into this saber rattling between the Eternal Dominion and the Felkan Kingdom.\n\nFunny how that feeling turns out to be true.\n\nLate one night you and Brenda are awakened from your sleep. Some envoy from the Felkan Kingdom has sudden decided to show up in the middle of the night. Demanding to see the pair of you and claiming it\u2019s very urgent. You and Brenda don\u2019t get much sleep as it is, so you\u2019re inclined to tell your soldiers to just shoot him and go back to bed, but you\u2019ve got a good idea of who it is.\n\n\u201cYou really think it\u2019s him?\u201d Brenda ask.\n\u201cYou really think it isn\u2019t? It was only a matter of time. Ugh, I guess we better get this over with.\u201d\n\nYou shout at the guard behind the door to hold the envoy in the meeting room and keep a close eye on him until you and Brenda get there. After grumbling and getting dress you and Brenda head to the meeting room where you see a familiar face. He\u2019s missing an eye, all of his hair and his face has a few more winkles and scars on it now, but you still recognize him.\n\n\u201cWarrick, you better have a damn good reason for waking us up in the middle of the night.\u201d You say.\n\u201c\u2026you aren\u2019t surprised it\u2019s me?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, I actually thought you\u2019d show up sooner, and how the hell did you manage to join the Felkan Kingdom anyway?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026but well anyway, I\u2019m glad to see you both. I was surprised to hear about your marriage. Didn\u2019t think that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWarrick, I\u2019m tired as well. It\u2019s not easy running a nation and I\u2019ve been doing it even longer than my husband has, so get to the damn point of the visit or let this wait until tomorrow.\u201d Brenda demands rubbing one of her eyes.\n\nWarrick looks a little hurt by your remarks, but he gets on with it.\n\n\u201cVery well, to business. The Felkan Kingdom wants an alliance with you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah sort of figured that. Anything else?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cErm, no, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay then, the answer is no. We can talk more about old times tomorrow, if you want. Good night.\u201d Brenda says starting to turn around to go back to bed.\n\u201cHey wait! No? Just like that?! You don\u2019t even want to consider the benefits?\u201d Warrick asks.\n\u201cWhat benefits? If we ally with the Felkan Kingdom, all it\u2019s going to do is piss off the Eternal Dominion who we have a good relationship with diplomatically and tradewise. What is the Felkan Kingdom going to offer?\u201d Brenda replies.\n\u201cHow the fact that we\u2019re more likely to leave you alone after the war with the Eternal Dominion is over?\u201d\n\u201cWarrick\u2026Warrick\u2026you should know threats aren\u2019t going to sway us.\u201d You remark.\n\u201cWhat?! NO! I meant, argh look. What I\u2019m saying is if the unfortunate should happen and the Eternal Dominion wins don\u2019t you think that they\u2019ll try to invade you next?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible yes.\u201d\n\u201cWhereas if the Felkan Kingdom wins, we have no intention on even expanding our borders.\u201d\n\u201cProbably true, but that still doesn\u2019t help us during the war. A war that is really between you and the ED.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m trying to convince YOU of all people to go to war. I would\u2019ve thought you would\u2019ve jumped at this chance!\u201d Warrick says in a raised tone.\n\u201cThings change Warrick, and just because I\u2019m not jumping through your hoops doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve lost a taste for battle. But I\u2019m thinking on a grander scale now. Going to war with the Eternal Dominion doesn\u2019t do us or Nalin any good. It\u2019s just going to result in dead soldiers at best. We\u2019ve found that our continued expansion eastward is much better in building up the country. Maximum gain with minimum losses.\u201d You say.\n\nWarrick paces a bit and sputters. He obviously thought this was going to go better.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it then huh? You just take Edgar\u2019s side over mine. I thought you didn\u2019t like him anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWarrick, it\u2019s not about taking sides. If you haven\u2019t noticed we\u2019re not exactly allied with the ED either. We trade with them and are on friendly terms, but that\u2019s out of convenience more than anything. Trust me, Edgar\u2019s been trying to get us to join for years. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even worried about, the Eternal Dominion is formidable I\u2019m sure, but the Felkan Kingdom survived a war with the Empire. I\u2019m guessing you should be able to handle the ED.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can.\u201d He calmly states.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence where you weren\u2019t expecting him to say such a thing so blatantly like that.\n\n\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t want to say anything. The Felkan Kingdom is what I serve now and I serve it to the best of my abilities as I did the Empire. To do anything less would be a failure as an Eternal on my part.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\u201cBut I see the weaknesses that we have and I can\u2019t ignore them. It\u2019s not public knowledge to anyone outside the kingdom, but we\u2019re also suffering a large gnoll invasion from the west. It caught us completely by surprise. The Felkan Kingdom is a mighty nation, but right now it\u2019s straining its resources just to stay alive. A war with the ED\u2026and we all know it\u2019s coming, could break us. The funny thing is I feel like I\u2019m in the Empire all over again. You know during the bad times.\u201d\n\u201cI think they were ALL bad times Warrick. We just made the best of them.\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cPerhaps. (sigh) I guess I can\u2019t convince you ally with us, I mean you\u2019ve got a good thing going on here and you shouldn\u2019t wreck it. I\u2019m glad. Glad that some of us are doing well. But couldn\u2019t you at least break off your trade routes? I mean that would at least cause Edgar\u2019s attention to be diverted. He might suspect you\u2019re up to something and not attack the Felkan Kingdom. At least not right away. It might be enough time for us to put up a better defense.\u201d\n\u201cYeah and he might also attack us instead.\u201d Brenda remarks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will, because then he has to divert his own soldiers and resources and then he\u2019ll be worried that we will attack. He can\u2019t fight a two front war, even Edgar\u2019s smart enough not to risk that. And that\u2019s if he dares fighting you in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big if, there Warrick.\u201d You say.\n\nYou and Brenda tell Warrick you\u2019ll both discuss this in a little more detail outside. He says he understands and will await your decision.\n\nYou and Brenda don\u2019t have too much to talk about really, since it\u2019s basically coming down to helping out a former comrade in arms and starting a possible war with another one or avoiding the situation entirely. Brenda is for staying neutral; oddly you\u2019re actually of two minds of this.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay neutral", "result": "As much as you might like to help Warrick out, you just really aren\u2019t in a position to do so on any meaningful level. Breaking your trade routes with the Eternal Dominion is just foolish. You tell Brenda you\u2019ll break the news this time.\n\nYou both enter the room where Warrick awaits your answer.\n\n\u201cSorry Warrick, while we do understand your troubles, we can\u2019t help you. What you\u2019re asking for is too much and we see no benefit for us or Nalin in general.\u201d\n\nWarrick\u2019s face doesn\u2019t drop and he doesn\u2019t get any angrier, All in all, he takes your response a lot better than Edgar did.\n\n\u201cVery well. I shall tell my superiors that you are not interested in any sort of alliance with us. I hope that one day this may change. I suppose I will also take my leave now, sorry to have bothered the both of you, but it was still good to see you again.\u201d He says and leaves immediately.\n\nYou and Brenda remark on he was probably more disappointed than he let on, but what\u2019s done is done and you\u2019ve all made your choices now. The pair of you go back to bed and try to get some sleep.\n\nYear 56\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about this epidemic. If this keeps up we\u2019re not going to have a population left to rule over!\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cWell so far the problem has hit the eastern territory of Nalin yet. We\u2019ve scoured the land for healers, medics and a few hedge wizards and they\u2019re doing all they can, but this thing is really bad in a few of the towns. I\u2019ve quarantined all of the major areas where this plague is taking place, but understandably a lot the soldiers aren\u2019t exactly keen on their duties there mainly because they don\u2019t want to get sick either. The only ones who aren\u2019t kicking up much of a fuss about it are soldiers with families in those towns.\u201d You reply.\n\u201c(Sigh) Shit. I\u2019ve talked to all of the advisors and nobody has a clue where, who and why this thing might\u2019ve started. You got any ideas?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately the only one I can think of just a hunch, and I\u2019d rather not believe it. I think Warrick, or at least the Felkan Kingdom had something to do with it. For all we know they could\u2019ve had saboteurs in here for years planning this.\u201d\n\u201cIf it was them, I hope Edgar rips them a new asshole now that he\u2019s at war with them.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019m still hoping that wasn\u2019t the case, not because I don\u2019t want to believe a former friend could do this to us, but more because it doesn\u2019t reflect well on my duties to protect the nation. I mean if the Felkan Kingdom had saboteurs here, how was it that I didn\u2019t see it until now?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t start doubting yourself, we need to focus on the problem at hand first.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right of course. Well as I see it, if we really want to stop the plague, we need to kill everyone in the quarantined areas, then cleanse everything with fire.\u201d\n\u201cWait, hold on. There\u2019s no other way? Can\u2019t we just have more medics and healers transferred to those places?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what good that would do. From the reports a lot of these people are practically dead or dying as it is. It doesn\u2019t do any good for them to linger and possibly get others sick. Better to just kill them now and save the medics to observe the places that only have a few sick people.\u201d\n\u201cYou do realize that something like this is not going to be popular right? I mean are the soldiers even going to be willing to do such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cWell we try pretty hard to keep up the old ways of Empire indoctrination, I don\u2019t think we should have major problems, though I suppose those with families might protest (Sigh) I guess we\u2019ll have to take care of them as well.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t sounding like a great idea. Maybe we should just keep the quarantine and let them all slowly die off. We could always say we\u2019re looking for a cure, and whether one comes or not, the problem will take care of itself.\u201d Brenda suggests.\n\u201cThe problem with that plan is we\u2019re diverting soldiers from more important duties and continuing to risk lives that can still be useful to Nalin.\u201d You say.\n\nYou and Brenda weigh the pros and cons of your limited choices.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill everyone in the quarantine", "result": "Ultimately, when in doubt killing everyone has worked for you on several occasions in the past, no reason to change tactic now. Brenda really doesn\u2019t think this is such a good idea, but you convince her that if there is going to be problems you might as well get them over with quickly.\n\nFirst thing you do is get every remaining \u201cold guard\u201d officer that\u2019s still serving since the days of the Empire and have them put in charge of this operation. You know they won\u2019t even question this command coming from you. Then you tell them to go through their personnel rosters to see who is going to be up for this grim task. You personally suggest to include all of those elves you made into orphans years ago. While they may all be good indoctrinated soldiers now, you think they wouldn\u2019t hesitate at a chance to kill some humans and would be good candidates for this job. Besides, elves seem to be more resistant to the plague anyway.\n\nThree entire towns are put to the sword, gun and torch until there is nothing left, but burned corpses and hollowed out buildings. In keeping with non-humans being seemingly less affected by the plague, you have kobolds remove the bodies and clean out what they can. They\u2019re more than happy to do this as they get the chance to loot some stuff for their own impoverished reservation you\u2019ve set aside for them.\n\nThis action causes an outcry, which hasn\u2019t been seen in a long time. Not even when conscription was implemented were things this bad. As predicted you have to execute several soldiers who took up arms against you during the cleansing. Many Nalin citizens aren\u2019t happy with the fact that you\u2019ve implemented several non-humans in helping with this massacre as well. Indeed some begin calling you their inhuman \u201cEternal overlords.\u201d\n\nAs far as the plague goes, you did successfully wipe it out from being an ongoing danger. Medics, healers and the like are able to focus their attentions on the places where it\u2019s less of a problem and eventually it is gone completely.\n\nThe repercussions of this action are that you now have a split nation. Eastern Nalin is still prosperous as the plague barely even reached the area. You also still have all of your supporters mainly from there who appreciate the fact that you stopped the plague from spreading. Western Nalin however is a mess and pockets of lawlessness begin to appear. You naturally take steps in trying to curb this problem by being more oppressive\u2026\n\nYear 60\n\n\u201cYou want to move the capital?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. It\u2019s obvious that eastern Nalin is where the prosperity is, I don\u2019t see why us as rulers shouldn\u2019t be living there instead.\u201d Brenda remarks.\n\u201cI do. By having the seat of power here, we still maintain control over this area and are displaying a show of dominance. If we go running to the east, it looks like we\u2019re effectively abandoning the area and that\u2019s going to make the less desirable elements here even more motivated to pursue whatever lawlessness they want. We need to maintain control.\u201d\n\u201cWell what if I don\u2019t? Ever since the plague hit, it\u2019s been a downward spiral for western Nalin. We\u2019ve tried and tried to get it back to what it once was, but throwing soldiers at the problem is just a bandage. It didn\u2019t help that you had soldiers shaking down people looking for other possible Felkan Kingdom saboteurs.\u201d\n\u201cI had to be sure to make sure something like the plague didn\u2019t happen again!\u201d\n\u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t like losing control of anything and we\u2019ve had arguments about how the plague was handled to begin with, but we are in a spot now that we need to make a serious change in things if we want to avoid getting overthrown by mobs and our heads on pikes in the future.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, like that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cI said in the future, not immediately. And don\u2019t be so sure of yourself, you\u2019re not twenty anymore you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know that!\u201d\n\u201cDo you? Because sometime I wonder. I love you and you\u2019re still a great warrior and you\u2019re probably still better than most men half your age, but you can\u2019t go around thinking you\u2019re invincible anymore. There are guns now you know, someone could just assassinate you from a few feet away and not even engage you in combat. The days of the Empire are over, you have to realize that.\u201d\n\u201cI know that too, Brenda.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re frustrating to deal with sometimes, because you DO know it, yet sometimes you completely lapse into the mindset of the good old days.\u201d\n\u201cSo what the hell are you proposing? That we just relinquish complete control of the western Emp\u2026Nalin? That we run and hide to the east, because it\u2019s easier?\u201d\n\u201cLet me put this into terms you can understand. Eastern Nalin is healthy, thriving even. Western Nalin is very sick and slowly dying. It can\u2019t be cured, so what\u2019s the best way to deal with it? Cut it off and focus on the more important area that is still of use.\u201d\n\nBrenda\u2019s analogy to your idea of how you handled the plague makes sense even if you don\u2019t want to admit it. Brenda\u2019s right about a lot of things, you aren\u2019t young anymore. You haven\u2019t been for a long time and even though you aren\u2019t even on the frontlines of any fighting anymore you find yourself getting tired and weary of the constant conflict that Nalin has been suffering from the past few years.\n\nYou\u2019ve tried to halt the ravages of time to the best of your abilities, but ultimately even as an Eternal, you\u2019re not immune to such things. You begin to wonder if the past few years were more about you wanting to relive your \u201cyouth\u201d a bit rather than seeking out possible traitors, saboteurs, and other dissidents.\n\nYou could insist on staying and Brenda would probably go along grudgingly, but she\u2019s also right. You\u2019re just going to become even more hated by the citizens in this area and it only takes one dumb ass peasant with a with a gun or even a bomb, to kill you. Maybe at one point you wouldn\u2019t have even cared if that had happened, but you\u2019ve had a long and enjoyable life with Brenda for several years now. A relationship you never even dreamed of before it happened.\n\nYou see now that want to live as long as possible with her as your older years advance, because ultimately she is the only other one you have in your life and the only other one that is going to understand you.\n\n\u201cOkay Brenda. Let\u2019s cut off the sick limb.\u201d You say.\n\nBrenda is happy you see reason and her plan is set in motion.\n\nOver the next few months, the Nalin government is relocated to one of the bigger central towns in the eastern territory, Adlen. The town soon swells to become a city with the influx of people. Military is pulled out of the west next. A few soldiers desert and don\u2019t follow in this exodus, but you just let it go. If they don\u2019t want to be here, then it\u2019s better off that they aren\u2019t. Most merchants and businesses are the next to follow.\n\nAfter these major transfers, western Nalin is declared no longer under protection and an independent territory. This causes some debate on if eastern Nalin is still \u201cNalin\u201d since technically it was never part of the territory originally. After some discussion eastern Nalin is renamed the nation Naleen. Most of the eastern citizens have oddly developed an accent in which they\u2019ve been pronouncing \u201cNalin\u201d like that anyway for years.\n\nAs for Nalin, the people that still dwell there are either happy about it or too poor to move. You figure the biggest winners will be the kobolds, at least until the Eternal Dominion sends in forces to take the land, assuming they have the time and manpower. You\u2019ve heard they\u2019re doing well against the Felkan Kingdom, but things could always change.\n\nIn any event none of it is your concern anymore. Still, you hope that this really is the last time you have to make a big move like this again, you don\u2019t know if you want to bother with a third time.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass...", "result": "Year 70\n\nIt\u2019s a calm night and you stand outside on the balcony of your palace and look down at the city of Adlen. Brenda comes out to join you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good when everything is going well isn\u2019t it?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going better for us now. Certainly going better than it is for Prime Eternal Edgar too.\u201d\n\u201cAlways thought that was a ridiculous title. I don\u2019t understand how he\u2019s at a stalemate with the Felkan Kingdom, he was doing so well against them for the longest time.\u201d\n\u201cI figured he\u2019s eventually over extend himself, though he\u2019s also had a few personal set backs like several assassination attempts for one. From his last letter he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing too well healthwise. He says the last two times he\u2019s been stabbed, the assassin\u2019s knife was coated with a heavy duty poison. The bolt that went into his back was too. If he wasn\u2019t an Eternal he\u2019d probably be dead by now.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s better than Warrick.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but from that letter Edgar sent, he said Warrick died at the battle of Yaquan six years ago. Regardless of his loyalties, he died like how an Eternal is supposed to die. Edgar will be lucky if he dies from a successful assassination, because it\u2019s sounding like the poison build up in his system might get him first. He\u2019s sick and weak. It\u2019s a shame really, I remember him being so hale and hearty at one time. If I were him I\u2019d probably give up the ruling nonsense, join his soldiers in the next battle and die in one last blaze of glory.\u201d\n\u201cIs that how you wish to die? You want to go out in one last blaze of glory?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cEh, sometimes I still think about it, but not really seriously. I guess I\u2019ve finally grown past it.\u201d You laugh.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think that would happen actually.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if Naleen starts suffering an unstoppable rebellion I guess I still got a shot at it. I\u2019ll meet the unwashed mobs with sword in hand.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, well if that happens I guess I\u2019ll join you, because I\u2019m too old to be moving the capital again.\u201d\n\nYou both smile and hold each other side by side still looking out at the city. Yes, life is good when things are running well.\n\nYear 75\n\nYou, Brenda and your elite guards step into Edgar\u2019s palace, and it\u2019s every bit as impressive as you thought it would be. Lots of statues, symbols of war, etc. Certainly a lot of bigger than your humble palace, but then Edgar always was one for overcompensation. You all are taken through the palace to see Edgar, along the way you and Brenda continue to take in some of the sights.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t weird that all those years we served the Empire that this the first time we\u2019ve ever stepped foot into this place?\u201d Brenda says.\n\u201cYeah, Edgar must\u2019ve spent a fortune rebuilding it.\u201d\n\u201cDid he ever actually meet the emperor?\u201d\n\u201cNo he never did. He said he assumed that he either fled or burned up in the fire, by the time he got to the palace. For all we know, maybe there never was an emperor.\u201d\n\u201cJust one of life\u2019s mysteries I guess.\u201d\n\nEventually you reach the royal bedroom. An older woman is sitting on a chair outside sobbing. She looks regal. You wonder if this is \u201cEva\u201d that he\u2019s referred to a couple times in his letters. She\u2019s not exactly his queen since she\u2019s human, but you know she is definitely his companion. Another older muscular man with a stern expression is standing nearby pacing. When you arrive, he frowns even more.\n\n\u201cOh so you two decided to come after all. A pity.\u201d He says.\n\u201cAnd who the hell are you exactly?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHmm, not surprised a deserter like you doesn\u2019t remember me. My name is Rissok and I served under you during the Empire riots. I saw you kill my friend in cold blood. A true Eternal who served with honor!\u201d\n\n\u201cOooooh now I remember. You and your other buddy were looting houses while Felding was attempting to rape a woman. Yeah, real honor there.\u201d You say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mock me! You are only here because the Prime allows it! If it were up to me, I would have you labeled as a traitor and have you killed!\u201d\n\nAt this point your guards take up a defensive stance and Rissok\u2019s do likewise.\n\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re going to make a move, better do it quick.\u201d You say.\n\u201cStop it! Stop it please! My Edgar is dying! Can\u2019t we have one moment without murder and killing?\u201d the woman sobs.\n\nAt this point Rissok storms off without another word, the guards stick around and tell you that you and Brenda may enter at any time, but your own guards must stay outside. Before you do, Brenda addresses the woman.\n\n\u201cWe apologize, we did not mean to cause you distress. Are you Lady Eva by any chance?\u201d\n\u201c(sniff) Yes. Yes I am.\u201d\n\u201cEdgar\u2019s spoken highly of you in his letters.\u201d Brenda says which causes a slight smile on her face.\n\u201cI know that he\u2019s better than me in everyway being an Eternal, yet he shows such compassion and sweetness by making me, a non-eternal, his only companion. I don\u2019t know what I ever did to deserve such an honor, but I will always be grateful for it.\u201d\n\nBrenda asks her if she wants to come in too, but she says she has already said her goodbyes and that he wants to see you both alone when you arrive. Having no other questions, you both enter the bedroom.\n\nWhen you see Edgar, he\u2019s lying in his bed and looking completely unwell. He\u2019s pale and his face has a gaunt looking appearance. You can\u2019t even believe this is the same man you fought along side at Fort Defiance.\n\n\u201cEdgar?\u201d you ask just to make sure.\n\u201c(wheeze) ah\u2026you both came\u2026I knew you would. (cough cough) There isn\u2019t much time\u2026I trust you\u2019ve read my letter?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you know that when my death comes, anarchy will ensue.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a successor?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but I imagine Brenda has and that\u2019s we can\u2019t have children.\u201d\n\nYou look at Brenda and she nods and mentions she learned that with Roldan when they were together. It\u2019s never been a topic you\u2019ve brought up, but you always had your suspicions. Edgar continues his speech.\n\n\u201cWe Eternals seem to be sterile or barren. I\u2019ve had people try to look into this problem, but they haven\u2019t come up with anything yet. It would seem what makes us superior, takes away our ability to reproduce. Maybe it\u2019s nature balancing itself out, so that we don\u2019t take over the world like so many of our younger eternals seem to want to do. Anyway (cough cough) I\u2019ve drawn up official forms for the only two I think could be proper successors\u2026\u201d\n\nYou already know where Edgar is going with this.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2026don\u2019t say that\u2019s why you dragged us out here\u2026Edgar they aren\u2019t going to listen to us! We aren\u2019t even ED citizens!\u201d\n\u201cThis is rather unrealistic Edgar.\u201d Brenda adds.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re still Eternals! (wheeze cough) They\u2019ll listen more likely than you believe, why do you think I always spoke so highly of you two? The younger ones will most likely follow without question, your major opposition will probably be the second generation\u2026but there aren\u2019t too many of them left, you could easily purge them all if you had to. Please\u2026I tried to build something here\u2026(cough) but I can\u2019t go on any longer. The only people who can guide the Eternal Dominion into something worthier are you two. I\u2019m asking not just as a dying man or friend \u2026but as a (cough cough) a fellow Eternal\u2026\u201d\n\nYou and Brenda look at each other and you both know your answer. Edgar\u2019s trying to guilt you into this mess, but it\u2019s just not going to work. This plan of his is doomed to fail and you know it. Every high ranking Eternal is probably going to be vying for power. And you and Brenda have your own nation, your own lives, and you\u2019ve told Edgar this before, but it\u2019s time to tell him one last time.\n\n\u201cEdgar, we\u2019re not accepting this position. First of all it\u2019s not realistic despite what you want to believe and I think deep down you know that. Second of all, these are your final moments Edgar. Don\u2019t worry about what you accomplished and if it\u2019ll last. Just be proud of it now and spend your last moments with your wife or whatever you consider her. That\u2019s who you need to be concerned about.\u201d\n\nEdgar hacks and coughs up blood and spits it into a nearby bucket and struggles to breathe, but manages to answer you.\n\n\u201cVery well\u2026you\u2019ve made your point. And you\u2019re probably right. You usually were. (wheeze) Bring my\u2026my wife in. I do wish to spend the last moments with her\u2026and farewell\u2026my Eternal siblings.\u201d\n\u201cFarewell Edgar.\u201d You say with a nod. Brenda says goodbye as well before you both leave.\n\nYou step outside and tell Eva that Edgar wants to spend his remaining time left with her. She seems happy with this idea though of course still upset. She runs in and you, Brenda and the rest of your group are escorted out and back to the carriage that brought you here.\n\nWhen you finally get back to Naleen, you and Brenda are both glad to be home, though you both talk for quite awhile about this recent event and how it\u2019s odd to think that you both are going to be the only original Eternals left soon.\n\nA couple days later you get the news that Edgar has died and that the new leadership of the Eternal Dominion as of now is uncertain. Fortunately you don\u2019t really have to worry about it. Naleen is strong enough and far enough away that any sort of chaotic attack from the new ruler is very unlikely. You suspect that most of the fighting will be within the ED itself, or pushing ahead against the Felkan Kingdom.\n\nIn the meantime you wonder about your own legacy and if you\u2019ll be remembered on any meaningful level. Brenda isn\u2019t really concerned about it; she figures you\u2019ll both be in the history books as the first rulers of Naleen if nothing else. That sounds fine, but you wonder if that would necessarily be the case, after all you never met the emperor, you don\u2019t even know his name or really anything about him except what you were taught as a child and that was most definitely all propaganda. You know even less about his predecessors. History may very well remember the Empire, but information on its rulers is either going to be sketchy or non-existent in another century. Edgar will probably be forgotten in even less time.\n\nYou get the idea that a solid written record is in order.\n\n\u201cSince when are you a writer?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not, but maybe we can work on this together, I mean you are part of this too.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly true. Okay, so how did you want to go about this?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Create a book painting you in a positive light", "result": "While you toy with the idea of creating a book telling the complete truth, but decide it would probably be better to just do one as a partial propaganda piece. People have enough excuses to complain about you, no need to add more sticks to the fire.\n\n\u201cSounds like that might be for the best. So are you going to still start from the beginning?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll briefly touch upon some of my time serving the Empire, but I\u2019ll mostly deal with when Nalin broke away from it and beyond. Obviously I\u2019ll focus on the most memorable parts, not the times where I just sat around reading skirmish reports.\u201d\n\u201cStill going to take a while you realize.\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be in one night, but I feel like a lasting record of us should exist. I mean after we\u2019re gone, who\u2019s to say that we won\u2019t be forgotten soon after? I mean I understand what Edgar was trying to do, but sadly I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be remembered in the scheme of things. I don\u2019t think the Eternal Dominion is even going to survive too much longer now that he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, you might be right about that. So you don\u2019t mind that the book might be excessively biased?\u201d\n\u201cBrenda, ALL history is biased in favor of its victors. Why should we be any different? Besides, I\u2019m sure people will make up more than enough lies about us to make up for it when we\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019re probably right about that too. Okay then, let\u2019s get started, I want to make sure I\u2019m in a good portion of this history as well.\u201d Brenda says with a smile.\n\nYou and Brenda immediately get to work on your project. You and her take turns doing the writing for the most part, but the pressures of ruling sometimes get in the way, so it takes longer than it probably would have if you both didn\u2019t have other responsibilities.\n\nYour ambitious project takes more than a few years to complete, but when it is finally finished you definitely feel a sense of accomplishment. It may not be conquering an enemy or territory or anything like that, but if this goes the way you want, you will have achieved much more than simple victory. You will have achieved a kind of immortality.\n\nThe huge tome immediately copied several times when it is complete. The great thing about being a ruler is you\u2019ve got underlings that can do this. You make sure to keep the original writing for yourself. The first copies go out to a few Naleen schools, libraries and other places of higher learning where you decree that it is to become required reading. (Another great thing about being in charge!)\n\nIn time there probably isn\u2019t a single citizen that hasn\u2019t at least heard of the book, if not read it. There are a few criticisms about the book from intellectual types claiming that it is little more than the usual propaganda, but such people don\u2019t voice such opinions for very long or they quickly shut up about them. For the most part though, the book brainwashes the masses enough that you at least never have to worry about any possible uprisings again.\n\nYear 101\n\n\u201cBrenda\u2026did you say that our book Eternal Vigilance has reached lands outside Naleen?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cYes, I have been told as much, but from what I\u2019ve heard it isn\u2019t popular like it is here. It\u2019s been dismissed as little more than the fat musings of tyrants\u2026that would be us.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I suppose everyone\u2019s a critic. Well I guess we at least we\u2019ll probably be remembered by our subjects, for however long that lasts.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry about such things right now, it\u2019s not important.\u201d\n\u201cI know Brenda. I suppose it was just a last foolish attempt to keep the Empire alive. I know it sounds odd, but even though the Empire fell long ago, I still felt like it existed in a small form as long as we original Eternals lived. Silly I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was just something that you believed in. No sillier than any of the gods that people worship.\u201d\n\u201cHrm. The gods. We never were a religious bunch were we? I wonder after I die if I\u2019ll meet any of the gods if they even exist.\u201d\n\nBrenda gets a bit quiet at that last statement, you don\u2019t mean to upset her, but you\u2019ve got to be realistic at this stage.\n\n\u201cBrenda, I love you.\u201d You say.\n\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d She says back and squeezes your hand.\n\nFor a moment the two of you are just silent for a while. You\u2019re were getting tired anyway, but the both of you don\u2019t really need to speak to communicate. You know each other better than any two people could. You\u2019ve been through a lot together and this is will be your final journey with her.\n\nAs you begin to get sleepy, you surprise Brenda by making a small chuckle.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cCaptain Gruz\u2026he said I would outlive everyone. I\u2019m glad to have proved him wrong.\u201d You say and give Brenda a smile. She manages to smile back through the tears.\n\nLife is slipping away now. This your final battle against an opponent who has stalked you for over a century.\n\n\u201cFor the Empire\u2026\u201d you whisper as your last battle cry and finally succumb to eternal sleep.\n\nYour funeral is a big deal. All of Naleen comes out for it, and there is a lot military marching, saluting, and all of that. Various officials give several speeches in your honor about your deeds and accomplishments. Brenda says a few words, but your death has been an emotional drain on her and she saves her strength to get through the day.\n\nYou\u2019re ultimately placed in a fancy tomb with nice statues of you and Brenda in your \u201cwarrior prime\u201d just inside the doorway of it.\n\nA couple months later Brenda joins you in death and she is placed in the same tomb by your side where upon it is sealed, shutting the pair of you in darkness forever.\n\nYour place in history is remembered best in the nation of Naleen, but as time goes on as time always does, you are remembered less fondly. Eventually there comes a day when the latest rulers have your books burned altogether as to establish their own cult of personality. Your book never reached many other far off lands and if it did, it wasn\u2019t wide spread to cause any significant impact.\n\nThe nation of Naleen goes through various changes of government systems as decades pass by and you and Brenda ultimately become just \u201cnames\u201d of past rulers and not much more than that.\n\nUltimately when it too ceases to be (Conquered by the great kobold/usksha alliance three hundred years later) you are forgotten altogether. Though the kobolds and usksha still stay far away from the graveyard ruins of your tomb, fearing it to be cursed and believing that disturbance will cause the vengeful spirits of the Eternals to rise up.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Tell the whole story", "result": "While creating a book for all the masses to read and absorb might help solidify a remembrance of you and Brenda, you\u2019re thinking on a bigger picture.\n\n\u201cWait, you want to tell your experiences from the past seventy five years?\u201d\n\u201cWell, just the most memorable ones. Obviously I\u2019m not going to focus on the days where I just sat at a desk reading skirmish reports or what I was eating on a particular day.\u201d\n\u201cDo you realize how long that\u2019s going to take?\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be in one night. I want to tell the whole story or at least as much as I can.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty ambitious. I figured you were just going to start from Nalin\u2019s independence from the Empire at most.\u201d\n\u201cSee that\u2019s just it, I, WE didn\u2019t just suddenly appear when we took official control of Nalin and later Naleen. We\u2019ve got a lot of history behind us. We\u2019re Eternals and we\u2019re the last of our kind. There should be some sort of lasting record of us.\u201d\n\u201cLast of our kind? There\u2019s a whole nation of them if you remember.\u201d Brenda reminds you.\n\u201cYes and that\u2019s exactly my point. Do you think it\u2019s going to last? Do you think any of new generations are going to be stable enough to think beyond their own petty power? I\u2019d wager that they don\u2019t even continue the method to create anymore of them, now that Edgar\u2019s dead. He was the only one who was trying to leave a lasting legacy beyond himself. The rest of them? They\u2019re going to wonder why they\u2019re creating potential rivals and no longer bother.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be right about that. So, you weren\u2019t interested in creating this in a more positive light for people to remember you?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, I\u2019m pretty sure such a task is impossible. No matter how much propaganda I churned out for the masses, I\u2019m certain it wouldn\u2019t make the citizens start believing I\u2019m a nice person. Even the military doesn\u2019t think such a thing. This isn\u2019t going to be about making me look good. I\u2019ll let history decide that, but this written account will at least provide a solid guide from which they can judge.\u201d\n\u201cBut won\u2019t it still be biased?\u201d\n\u201cProbably, but given that I want to include everything, I\u2019m still not portraying myself as some benevolent ruler with a pleasant background. Now you said you would help, did you still wish to? I mean I want to include everything, but I guess I can leave out anything that portrays you in a negative way.\u201d\n\u201cMy love, I was right along side you on your less popular decisions, in fact I made a lot of them myself.
