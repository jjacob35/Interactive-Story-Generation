Couples dressed in medieval finery dance around you, ignoring the nearly naked man on the floor who just woke up. With surprise and embarrassment you realize you're only wearing a loose pair of breeches that only reach to your knees. You keep a hand on it to stop it from falling down.\n\n\n\"Ah! Another one. I had just begun to believe the party was over. Seems the second round has started! Grab a lady and begin the dance anew. Oh, you might want to put something on first. Or not. Whatever you think is an appropriate way to celebrate!\"\n\n\nA man sits in a stone throne a few steps up in front of you. He stares at you with dark red eyes as he taps his bare feet on the lovely gold and red carpets. His pure white hair is pushed back over his head, over his ears, and under a dull plain looking iron crown, more like a simple iron circle than a crown. He puts his hand over his chin in a thinking position.\n\n\n\"On second thought; that is the perfect way to celebrate! Everybody naked! Brilliant my speechless friend! Haha, someone grab my friend here a partner!\" He jumps up and rips off his coat.  \"Nevermind, I will!\" He grabs your hand and pulls you up, spinning you around and around.\n\n\nEveryone around you is going through the long process of undressing and he pushes you into the crowd, towards the only person done, a woman who gracefully catches you before you not very gracefully fall into the nearly naked bodies.\n\n\nYou don't know if this is a nightmare or a fantasy.", "action_results": [{"action": "Where am I?", "result": "She's behind you, holding you up. You get back your footing and turn around to face her. She grabs your hands and starts to dance, forcing you along. Her long black hair is pulled up into a ridiculous hairdo, nearly making you laugh, but her intense face stops you.\n\n\nYou open your mouth to ask the question, but she places one finger over her red lips.\n\n\nShe turns her head and looks at you.\n\n\nYou look around. The women have all stripped to down to their shifts and the men down to breeches or hose.", "action_results": [{"action": "Ignore her warning", "result": "As soon as you open your mouth again she pushes you away and stops dancing.\n\n\nThe crowd has stopped and is looking at you. The man, now minus his tight black pants, stares at you. You noticed that some of his guards are walking torwards you.\n\n\n\"Please, please, hold all questions until the end of the presentation.\" He claps and everyone resumes dancing.\n\n\nEveryone but you that is, as his guards have long since killed you and are now in the process of cleaning up the mess your blood leaves on the smooth tiles.", "action_results": []}, null]}]}
