The only light other than the candle Mama clutches in her hand comes from the moon, whose once bright, white, inviting and warm light is now deep red, like it's been splattered with blood. You're curled up with your two sisters, Ivana and Lilia, with Mama sitting over you, her candle in one hand and a wooden crucifix in the other. Papa is nailing boards to keep the door shut, hastily trying to give you some extra protection.\n\n\nIt's the Night of the Blood Moon. You've never been through one, the last happening less than a year before your birth, but now, after another twelve years, it had arrived. Your eldest brother, Dornan, told stories about it, stories that chilled you to the bone, that kept you from sleep, that gave birth to the horrors of your nightmares. If even a fraction of what Dornan said is true, the screams should begin soon.\n\n\n\"Mama?\" Lilia asks.\n\n\n\"Hush, darling,\" Mama replies, as Papa finishes boarding up the door and grabs his shotgun from it's place on the wall. He takes his spot next to you, his gun pointed at the door, and you wait.\n\n\nThe screams start soon. Howls of pain and terror from other houses of the town. Ivana is old enough to know to stay quiet, but Lilia soon starts to cry. Mama desperately tries to hush her six year old daughter, but to no avail.\n\n\n\"Sssh! Sssh, darling! It's alright, you just must stay quiet!\" Papa says.\n\n\nSuddenly, a tall, dark shadow passes by the window. Papa immediately grabs his shotgun, frantically raising it to his shoulder. The shadow disappears, and Papa breaths a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\"Scared of something?\" a deep, guttural voice says from behind you.\n\n\nPapa turns, firing his shotgun as the monster speeds forward. It grabs Papa's throat with unnatural speed, smiling as it holds him in the air, strangling him.\n\n\nThe monster looks hideous. It's dreadfully pale, it's face twisted with hate, and looks to be hairless. It's eyes are completely black, like the endless darkness of its soul, and it's mouth is filled with mangled teeth with two large fangs, curved and bloodstained, with even more blood pouring down its face. The creature snarls, before smiling as it turns to look at you and your siblings. \n\n\n\"Ah... so young... so fresh...\" the vampire says, licking it's lipless mouth with a forked tongue. \"Peasant, your daughters are mine. Don't struggle.\"\n\n\nThe vampire tosses Papa to the ground, turning towards your siblings.\n\n\n\"No! No! You will not take my daughters!\" Father says, grabbing for his gun.\n\n\nThe monster strikes, smashing it's boot into Papa's head.\n\n\n\"How dare you?!\" the monster screams. \"I gave you your land, I gave you your house, I give you your life!\"\n\n\nThe monster begins walking toward Papa, who desperately crawls back to the wall.\n\n\n\"I keep the beasts away from the village! I let you roam the night all but one night every twelve years! I don't ask for your wife, to allow you to sire more. I don't ask for your son, to leave you a legacy. I only ask for your daughters! How dare you attempt to deny me that?\"\n\n\nAs the vampire walks towards Papa, his fangs bared, you see a chance to get Papa's shotgun. Still, you don't want to anger the vampire further. Perhaps the best option is to hope for the beast's mercy.", "action_results": [{"action": "Grab for the gun", "result": "You scuttle forward for the gun, grabbing it. You aim it at the vampire, grabbing the trigger and pulling it tightly.\n\n\nThe gun explodes, sending you falling back with the recoil and smacking into the wall with a painful thud. The vampire roars as buckshot slams into his back. He grabs your father by the head, twisting with inhuman speed as your hear a painful snap. Then, he turns, staring at you. He snarls, walking forward quickly. You reach for the gun again, but he steps on your hand as you yelp in pain.\n\n\n\"You dare shoot me? I have lived millennia, you think you'll be the one to end my life?\" the hunter snarls, before laughing, a horrible, terrifying noise. \"You have balls, little one.\"\n\n\nYou stare at the monster in front of you, trying to stare him, but you see nothing but hate and unquenching thirst behind his eyes.\n\n\n\"Yes... I see strength in you. Potential. I have an offer for you, as the newfound man of the house. Join me. Let me take you on as my... apprentice. As my servant. As my slave. As whatever I need you to be. In exchange for your servitude, I offer you not only your life, but the life of your mother and sisters.\"\n\n\nYou stare at the monster, whose eyes narrow as he waits for you answer.", "action_results": [{"action": "Agree", "result": "\"OK,\" you say, gulping.\n\n\nThe vampire smiles, perhaps in an attempt to calm you, but the way his smile curves upwards seems unnatural. It's like the smile of a wolf who has found a young, bleating lamb all by itself.\n\n\n\"Perfect,\" the vampire says, dropping you to the ground.\n\n\nThe monster walks out of the hut, barking out a single order.\n\n\n\"Follow,\" he commands.\n\n\nYou walk outside to the glow of the red moon, seeing a dozen bodies, pale from blood draining, lying on the street. A single carriage lies there, with a hunch-backed man sitting there, wearing a low-down bowler hat, a balaclava and a large coat that cover his appearance.\n\n\n\"Haygarth! We're finished here. I've fed,\" the vampire growls.\n\n\nThe hunch-back nods eagerly, grabbing the reigns of the horses.\n\n\n\"Yes, sir, ready to go, sir!\" Haygarth says eagerly. \"And the boy?\"\n\n\n\"He is mine,\" the vampire says, as he steps into the carriage.\n\n\n\"Yes sir, yes sir! Up front, boy! Quickly!\" Haygarth says.\n\n\nYou quickly walk up to the carriage, climbing into the shotgun seat of the carriage. Haygarth seems badly deformed, clearly attempting to cover his appearance with his large coat, low hat and balaclava, but he still looks monstrous. Haygarth quickly stirs the horses into a trot, as you leave the town that's always been your home.\n\n\n\"You're to serve Count Grey?\" the hunchback asks.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" you say, barely coming to terms with the fact.\n\n\n\"Hmm... we'll see how long you last,\" Haygarth says. \"Yes, we'll see...\" ", "action_results": [{"action": "Three Years Later...", "result": "You sit on the ground, scrubbing the cold stone floor of the Grey Castle, named as much for its cold, lifeless demeanor as much as its owner. Haygarth stands over you, watching as he makes sure you do a proper job cleaning the blood stains that cover the ground, a remainder of the last girl foolish enough to be out at night. \n\n\nSo far, your job has been simple. You have little contact with Count Grey, as you work in the day and sleep at night, whilst he sleeps in the day, coming out at night to hunt, feed, plan and much more. Mostly, Haygarth forces you to work at any job he sees fit. He seems to think you're little different from a pack horse, working you as hard as them. If anything, he's feeding the pack horses better. You see your role in the castle as a servant on your more optimistic days, and as a slave on the worse ones.\n\n\n\"Good, good, put your back into it! Yes, that's it!\" Haygarth says, as he hurries around the room, collecting pieces of clothes left over from the poor girl being brutally murdered.\n\n\n\"Yes, Haygarth,\" you reply, putting your pressure on the brush as you splash some more water to get rid of a particularly disgusting stain of a mixture of blood and urine.\n\n\nHaygarth is a hard ruler, forcing you to work day and night. He's not sadistic or cruel, he just doesn't seem to understand that you're not an animal who needs a break. Hell, perhaps his only redeemable feature is the fact that he works himself even harder. As he rushes past, trying to do various chores, you can hear him angrily mutter to himself to go faster.\n\n\nYou finish off the stain, quickly crawling over to the next. You sigh as you realize just how much you need to clean. Your knees hurt from crawling around all day, your hands are covered in blisters, and you've done nothing but work all day. You had two ive minute breaks to cram food into your mouth, and one more to shit, and that was it. Who the fuck has only two people to keep an entire castle from falling into disrepair?\n\n\n\"Hurry up, boy! Use some of those strong muscles! I want to be able to see my reflection in it!\"\n\n\nWill he ever leave you be? The bastard can't just let you fucking work, he has to constantly remind you that you're not doing good enough? ", "action_results": [{"action": "Insult Haygarth", "result": "\"Really? You want to see your reflection in the floor? Maybe I should leave it dirty so you wouldn't have to look at your malformed, pathetic excuse for a face,\" you say, as a year of anger is released in a single jab.\n\n\nHaygarth stops suddenly, looking at you. He frowns, looking at the ground behind you, where ironically you've polished the stones enough for him to vaguely look at himself.\n\n\n\"You... you know, you sound just like my mother, or Count Grey. Mean. Cruel. Perhaps it's good you've found yourself serving a man such as the Count. He could be your soul mate, if he had a soul.\"\n\n\nHaygarth hobbles out of the room, leaving you alone. You continue keeping working, but fuck, the floor is pretty clean. You sit down, leaning against the wall as you sigh as your aching muscles get relief. You take a deep breath, as you watch the the sun fall in the distance. After about half an hour, the moon has finally appeared, and Haygarth appears.\n\n\n\"Come. We need to wake Count Grey,\" he says, not looking at you.", "action_results": [null]}, null]}]}, null]}]}
