Naturally you're not popular in high school, you're not even worthy to be routinely picked on. This isn't to say you aren't at all, but most people just find you very creepy and stay away from you. You're mom's strict upbringing has made you very emotionally detached and repressed. At this point you barely feel any kind of emotions at all.\n\nMaybe that changes today.\n\nYour Mom is calling you down to eat.", "action_results": [{"action": "Go downstairs", "result": "You head downstairs, like you always do. No point in breaking tradition.\n\nWhen you get downstairs your Mom is arguing with your 17 year old sister as usual. She isn't like you at all, she's popular for one thing, but then again being a very pretty and extroverted will do that for a person.\n\nShe's a bit of a wild child though which your domineering mother can't stand. You wonder why your sister acts the way she does, Mom's just trying to look out for her.\n\nThey're really arguing today.", "action_results": [{"action": "Sit down, eat and stay out of it", "result": "You sit and eat your breakfast quietly while the two argue as usual.

You're just mad because you're a fucking bitter old harpy with nobody in your fucking life!\"\n\"Why you fucking little bitch!\" your Mom says and slaps your sister across the face.\n\nYour sister holds her face and shuts up. She picks up her school stuff and heads toward the door, before exiting she says one last thing, before slamming the door.\n\n\"Don't worry Mom, I'm not staying in this fucking house another day!\"\n\nYou finish up your breakfast, your Mom doesn't even acknowledge you're there, she leaves the kitchen in a huff rather quickly.\n\nShe must be really pissed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to school", "result": "Mom's strong, she doesn't need you checking up on her.

Aaron isn't so much your friend in that he's such a social reject that you're the only one who doesn't treat him like a leper, so he's attached himself to you. Of course you could really care less about him. Sometimes you wish he'd leave you alone, since he only makes you stand out more, when all you want to do is blend into the background.\n\n\"Get the fuck up you faggot!\" Henry shouts abusively at Aaron while kicking him gleefully.\nAaron looks at you in the hopes that you'll help.", "action_results": [null, null]}, null]}, null, null]}]}
