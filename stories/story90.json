Raiding the detention center just to get a few kills on those who raped and pushed your crush to suicide doesn't seem like a good idea after all. You're not even her type to bother, you should just have left them rotting in jail instead. Now you got yourself rows and rows of police forces chasing after you and there is no such thing like a way back. You're brown bread to the eyes of your loved ones now, and you gotta make a run for it. Whenever you see a turn, you can only hope that it doesn't lead to a dead end.\n\n\nThat phone call should have never reached you. Crazy love, you blame all the things you've done to it. It forced you to flee your office, turned your mind into a madman and put that thing on your hand. After that, it was only chaos. You were gonna going to end your life when the flame inside died out...but didn't...and you still can't find the courage.\n\n\n\"PULL OVER!!! PULL OVER NOW!!! DO YOU HEAR ME?!! I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU!!!\"\n\n\nThey finally talk with bullets huh? Maybe you should focus on stepping on the gas instead of having random flashbacks.", "action_results": [{"action": "Shoot them, it's self-defense!", "result": "You're not surrounded so it'll be a real pain in the ass for them to even get a clear shot on you unless you stick your head out like a sore thumb. The tires though, immediately get your fingers fondling over to the stockpile of mass bloodshed you got straight from market. Unlocking the safety, you sprayed a barricade of piercing bullets with the friendly-user Uzi towards them. You don't dare to look, too nerve-retching and you can't afford to waste your focus on the road.\n\n\n\"THEY'RE FIRING AT US!!! CALLING FOR SUPPORT!! CALLING FOR SUPPORT!! HOLD THEM UP!!!\"\n\n\nSo they think there are accomplices involved? Man, that would have been very comforting at a time like this. This stuff is the thing that you can only see on movies, not experiencing it in real life and you can't have the fortune to share it with anyone...at least you'll have everyone wanting you in custody till death after this, a nice bonus for a loner like you.\n\n\nIt looks like your firepower struck them as the deadly stuffs, they pull over and start to station in one place, aiming solely at your buggy and throwing rounds as you speed up to oblivion. You're safe...at least for now. From a runaway, you've became a wanderer. The future ain't going to got any lights for you but you'll have to bear with that, you just have to. You don't want to die. No matter how much the world spy on your fear or judge you, you will not die on this small world.\n\n\n... Looking through the door and feeling all the wonderful sensations the wind let you enjoy, you seize your mind back in its origin, a calm and successful mind.\n\n\n\"Ha...Haah hah hahh! A hahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\" You fake the laugh of a psychopath to let all the tears built up inside fly along, waving your brows in every fit. \"...hahaha...damn...\"\n\n\nYou had sat there, laughing exactly like this just 2 hours ago, it more likely was belonged to a maniac, the one who put a bullet through a helpless person and cracked up in awe as his lover guided him towards the next targets. Revenge is never meant to be sweet, but it sure feels great afterward! Rocking the flow of blood in your veins, you drive through the clearing, followed by rains of falling leaves marking your exit.", "action_results": [{"action": "You need a smoke after all of that first...", "result": "You are John Namour, 28 years old, a normal secretary from some wealthy company which tries so hard to maintain its image that you have to question if all of your hard works really paid off working there. It's only thanks to Laura that you could enjoy your days signing sheets.\n\n\nA real beauty, she was...she was so naive, the things she could do sometimes. The opportunity of you getting to hold a conversation with her was like the Solar System lining up straightly. 21 vs 28, you thought you'd had your chance someday, assuming you could improve yourself into a braver, better man to give her the ring. You tried your best to understand her mind, her standing, her habits...by yourself. Hell! You even bought and gave expensive jewelries to her mother and her sister. Winning your soon-to-be-lovely-wife's family is your first...and your last affection.\n\n\nYour boss just couldn't allow it, could he?  What a friendly bunch of meatdrops he had in store for young women. You knew something was wrong when you saw that fucker's smug sweep at her. Just when things could have gotten any worse, Laura hung herself in her room. The moment her mother read the first word of her suicidal note to you over the phone, you were downright demonic. Instead of assuaging her, you scared her and everyone off with your sudden loud tone, demanding a clear explanation. The rest of the writing was about you, how you've cared for her and her family. You drew your first blood afterward.\n\n\n\"...hahhhh...\" You blow a few smoke off your lungs, a burning nicotine stick between your fingers. \"Useless...doesn't do a damn thing...\"\n\n\nYou are not made to love her, you're a hot-headed psychopath and you cringe at the thought of you abusing her. Before, you were writing paper and now, those fingers nearly mark you as a dangerous crackshot, an inspirational killer to the news and an idea living target practice for weapon maniacs.\n\n\n'Now is a good time to quit.' You think, looking at the remains of the cigarette before throwing the entire pack down to the road. '...I-I can't...I don't want to die.'\n\n\nA place where you can temperately settle down for a bit and hide from the eyes of media is crucial to you. Speaking of media, you have a thought of buying a mini TV to keep an eye on your case. You can bet your life on the police shooting you on sight right now. Mass shootout at the local and getting out alive, how much luck can you have?\n\n\nOne thing for sure, a trip to another country even though it seems like a good idea, you're not sure about the possibility of you getting on one without asking for an arrest. You don't even know if it's safe to buy some breads from a mere bakery. The more you think about it, the more you realize how deep the grave you have dug for yourself.\n\n\nKilling some rapists bastards...You should never expect society to forgive them or you. What a terrible crime you've committed!...You miss your home, your family. But you can't contact them, the cops will track your location, too risky and certainly isn't worth it. They probably are cursing themselves for having raised a murderer right now.\n\n\n...Besides, you can't even call for anyone if you want anyway.", "action_results": [{"action": "Drive to another town", "result": "TV...checked.\n\n\nSunglasses...checked.\n\n\nTrench coat...Unnecessary but you couldn't just leave your skinny bones out, it has doubled your luck and your appearance to be unique...Also checked.\n\n\nGood thing your face hasn't really hit the mark of any media type out there yet, but your time is running out. Lying low will have to be in another place, a safe and secure one far away from here.\n\n\nYou check the plate covering your gas meter and see that it still got 2/3 left. You have to stock on some large litters to cross the border. The nearest place to refill would be...about 15 miles from here, not really hard to come by and if they try something funny, your guns will do the job. You decide to go there.\n\n\n...Hmm? It's nearly night time. Anytime now...\n\n\nYou have arrived at a gas station. There are only a few local houses and shops nearby, an empty place and probably not in any urban business.
