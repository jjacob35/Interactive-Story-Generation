He studied hard in school and his parents supported his dreams for he was intelligent and hard working and they knew he could succeed if given the chance. They also wanted him to have a more stable and comfortable life than they did. (Much like their parents before them)\n\nDespite the high costs of a formal education of a person growing up in his middle class background, his parents who ran an inn, scraped together enough money to send him to a university and for awhile the young man was able to pursue his dreams.\n\nUnfortunately life doesn\u2019t always go as planned and one day the young man\u2019s father died and to make matters worse it turned out his father who only had the best intentions for his son, had been borrowing from a dangerous loan shark.\n\nWith his mother in danger of losing the inn, the young man had to put his dreams on hold and help his mother. It was a time of great stress for the young man, but in time he was able to not only keep the inn afloat and pay off the debt, but he was also able to turn enough profit to re-enroll at the university and eventually become the doctor he always wanted to be.\n\nDuring his time as an innkeeper however, he had become very close to a young barmaid by the name of Eliza. While their love didn\u2019t blossom immediately, he soon realized his feelings before it was too late and the two became romantically involved and in time they married.\n\nFor various reasons together they moved away from the city and to a quieter smaller town called Teckleville. There the young man opened a private practice and became a respected member of the community and had twins with Eliza.\n\nThese twins, a boy and a girl, had possibly even more of a loving home than their father did and they certainly had even more comforts and advantages. Truly when they grew up, they could be anything they set their minds to.\n\nHowever, once again life is not always so simple.\n\nAs they grew up, these twins became the scourge of Teckleville, always getting into mischief. Granted some misbehavior is expected from youth as they find their purpose in life, but it would seem no matter what, these two were bound and determined to pursue the life of crime.\n\nThe pair of them were rogues through and through and as they got older it was apparent they had no desire to change.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where our tale begins\u2026", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue", "result": "Year 16\n\nAs you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your twin sister is watching you with a slightly distracted expression. She\u2019s been looking like that a lot lately.\n\nYou know she can\u2019t be concerned about getting into trouble. The pair of you have been doing this since you were kids. You\u2019ve got this routine down pretty well at this point.\n\nWhile most of your small town is fully aware of your roguish ways, you\u2019re fortunate that you\u2019re both still young and your father is a good doctor and has some measure of influence in keeping you out of the local jail. Plus, it helps that you long since stopped stealing from the town itself and focused on stealing from people passing through Teckleville instead.\n\nStill, it isn\u2019t like either of your parents are pleased with your recreational criminal activities and have tried to steer you in a different direction with little success. While it tends to go in one ear and out the other with you, sometimes your sister listens occasionally.\n\nAnd you\u2019re pretty sure that\u2019s the cause of her distraction in-between your jobs. Something is on her mind and has been for a while now and today is the day she says as much.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk bro.\u201d your sister says.\n\u201cUh oh. You sound like mom. Which means this doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cI really wish you wouldn\u2019t set a negative tone to this already difficult situation. I\u2019ve been going back and forth about this multiple times, making myself sick over it actually.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\n\nYou sister exhales deeply and sits next to you.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me in this town.\u201d\n\u201cGee thanks, sis.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, I just\u2026(Sigh) look I know you don\u2019t listen to mom or dad, but I\u2019ve been thinking they\u2019ve got a point. I mean, what am I doing? What are WE doing? I mean when we were little kids, this was fun. Working together in near perfect harmony and avoiding trouble, but we\u2019re both sixteen now. We really going to be doing this for another sixteen years?\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing this straight out of the womb, sis.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I mean! What does the future hold for us? How long before dad just gets fed up and tells the town guard to throw us in jail for our own good?\u201d\n\u201cMom, wouldn\u2019t allow that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I think even mom has her limits. Besides, neither one may have a choice in protecting us, if we really fuck up one day.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re too good at this, we\u2019re not going to fuck up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, even if that is the case, I don\u2019t see staying here in Teckleville robbing travelling merchants as a stable future.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you saying exactly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m getting out. I\u2019m leaving town.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re silent for a moment. You knew that\u2019s where this was heading, but hearing it makes it real.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to go?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI dunno. Anywhere! Maybe Klyton, or Holgard or even the Delantium Kingdom. I\u2019ll figure it out during my travels. Just anywhere, but here.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And just how exactly are you going to support yourself?\u201d\n\u201cHalf of that stuff we steal is mine you know.\u201d Your sister points out.\n\u201cYeah, I know that, but that\u2019s not going to last forever and it isn\u2019t that much.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWell mom has always stressed how nice my voice is and how creative I am. And I think you know I\u2019ve been practicing my lute a lot more lately. I figured I might be a bard\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA bard?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you know. Singing tales, telling stories and getting into adventures\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026okay\u2026Yes, you\u2019ve got many talents. I mean it\u2019s why we work so well together. You distract folks with your charm and I do the rest. I\u2019ve always known that and I get that you\u2019ve always liked the attention you get from the marks more than the actual thievery. But I thought you said you were seeking a more stable future. Being a wandering bard doesn\u2019t exactly qualify.\u201d\n\u201cWell okay, maybe stable wasn\u2019t the right word, maybe DIFFERENT was more accurate. My point is, this is something I want to do and I can\u2019t be a proper bard unless I travel and experience the world! I can\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201d\n\nYour sister is quite serious about this and you know that there is going to be no deterring her from this path. This is going to change everything, but you\u2019re willing to roll with it.\n\n\u201cWell\u2026okay I suppose if this is something you want to do, I\u2019ll have to support it. You\u2019re probably right about sticking around here anyway, I know I get pretty bored in between waiting for the next mark. I assume you\u2019re probably already getting ready to leave soon. Just let me get my things together and I\u2019ll be ready\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot this time. I\u2019m going by myself.\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re really surprised.\n\n\u201cWhat?! But you can\u2019t! I mean\u2026who\u2019s going to look out for you? Don\u2019t you know how dangerous it is out there?\u201d you exclaim.\n\u201cHow would you know? You\u2019ve never left this town either!\u201d your sister points out.\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019ve heard things!\u201d\n\u201cAnd so have I. Look\u2026I\u2019m well aware that it isn\u2019t a safe world out there, but that\u2019s part of what I need to experience. I mean even here, with that overly aggressive asshole Klint hitting on me every other day, I know I\u2019m safe from him because you, mom and dad are around.\u201d\n\nYour sister continues.\n\nLook, I need to do this on my own. I need to fail or succeed on my own. I need to take care of myself, I mean don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve got the skills to do it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026I dunno\u2026I guess it\u2019ll just be sort of strange. We\u2019ve been a team for so long.\u201d\n\u201cI know. It\u2019ll be strange for me too since we\u2019re so close, but maybe this will be for the best anyway. I mean have you heard some of more recent ugly rumors about us just because we\u2019re twins?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sort of twisted where people\u2019s minds go. (Sigh) I guess this is goodbye. Are you leaving tonight, are you telling mom and dad?\u201d\n\u201cYes, as you correctly guessed I will be leaving tonight. As for telling mom and dad, I thought about it\u2026but I can only imagine the chaos that might cause with mom getting weepy and dad forbidding me to go anywhere. Hell, he might actually have the town guard throw me in jail just so I\u2019d have to stay! No, better just leave a note and take off in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cProbably the safest bet for you. Though of course you realize I\u2019m going to catch the fallout of this plan of yours. In fact I\u2019ll probably somehow get blamed for it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you will\u2026apologies.\u201d Your sister says.\n\u201cMeh, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll muddle through like I always do.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know you could leave too. I mean not with me of course, but you\u2019re a resourceful guy, I\u2019m sure you could make it outside this one horse town too. You did say you get bored here.\u201d Your sister says.\n\u201cYeah, but I dunno. I\u2019m not exactly multi-talented as you are and I doubt if I\u2019d be able to try my hand at a life not involving crime somehow. Plus, here I\u2019m probably the best thief in town. Elsewhere? I\u2019m probably an amateur that would get eaten alive by the bigger criminals. Besides, I still got a good thing going here. I admit though it\u2019s not going to be the same without your help.\u201d\n\nYour sister pats you on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Just remember what I said. You\u2019ve got more talent than you think and you could definitely do well out there too.\u201d\n\nMaybe there is some truth to that, but in any case, this is where you part ways with your blood partner in crime. You both hug knowing that you both are going to feel like part of you is gone, but perhaps your sister is right. Perhaps it will ultimately be better for you in the long term. At least for her since she does have talent other than petty thievery.\n\nLater that night, your sister takes off to parts unknown and you prepare yourself for the hell that your parents are no doubt going to raise. Truth be told, if you left, they probably wouldn\u2019t cause as much fuss\u2026okay well maybe that\u2019s not entirely true, but still, your sister has always been the favorite so they\u2019re going to take this hard.\n\nThey won\u2019t be the only one.", "action_results": [{"action": "Time Passes...", "result": "Six months later\u2026\n\nAs you sit counting your ill-gotten loot from the latest traveling merchant in town, your girlfriend is watching you with an exasperated expression. Of course she tends to look like that a lot.\n\n\u201cUgh. This part is soooo boring! I dunno why you didn\u2019t steal the jewelry, I liked some of those necklaces.\u201d Annah exclaims.\n\u201cBecause you know I prefer hard coin in my possession rather than anything else.\u201d You reply trying not to lose count.\n\u201cSo? You\u2019re not the only one involved in doing this you know! You couldn\u2019t just think about ME for once and steal some pretty items?\u201d\n\u201cAnnah, if you wanted one of those necklaces so bad, you could have just stolen it yourself. You were closer to the merchant and easily had him distracted.\u201d\n\u201cHe was gross. Breathing heavy and touching my legs, it was all I could do not to vomit\u2026y\u2019know you could have defended my honor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be one of those days\u2026\n\n\u201c(Sigh) And how exactly was I going to do that while I was breaking into his lockbox in his tent? The whole point is for me not to attract any sort of attention and that\u2019s getting more difficult to do what with a lot of the merchants hiring more guards nowadays.\u201d\n\nAnnah rolls her eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Annah was certainly drawn to you because she\u2019s a little on the wild side and doesn\u2019t have the best of reputations herself. While she certainly lets you do things to her that are a lot of fun, she\u2019s not the partner in crime that your sister was and she certainly complains a lot more. A LOT more.\n\nAnnah\u2019s got the looks and flirting down, but that\u2019s about it. Your sister actually had the talent to get the attention of people even if they weren\u2019t some weak willed slob that went nuts over the latest sweet young thing that batted their eyes at them. She could lure them with a tale or a song and keep a whole entourage captivated if need be.\n\nYou suppose Annah\u2019s lack of skill has had the benefit of increasing your own since you\u2019ve definitely had to be quicker and sneakier.\n\nStill, it isn\u2019t just her lack of skill and bitching that\u2019s the problem since that you can deal with. It\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s way more maintenance than you thought she\u2019d be and she\u2019s been getting worse in that aspect.\n\nYou know you\u2019re probably going to have to give her a little bit more this time around just to keep her appeased. At this point you haven\u2019t really been saving much at all and you were planning on moving out of your parents home by now because that situation hasn\u2019t gotten any better since your sister left.\n\nLately you\u2019ve been starting to wonder if you shouldn\u2019t just do what your sister did and leave. It\u2019s just getting to be too much hassle to steal in this town and it definitely isn\u2019t as much fun as it used to be.\n\nWhere you would go though, you aren\u2019t sure. You\u2019re going to have to figure it out.\n\nIn the meantime, you hand over Annah\u2019s share.\n\n\u201cOkay, here you go\u2026so what do you want to do now?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cWell since you were unwilling to steal me one of those nice necklaces, I guess I\u2019ll have to buy a cheap ass one from that hag that runs Sparkling Treasures.\u201d Annah replies.\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to Jasmine\u2019s shop.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and she\u2019s going to be giving me the evil eye the entire time. Thinking I\u2019m going to steal something.\u201d\n\u201cWell to be fair, you can\u2019t blame her. I\u2019ll come with you, but as far as I know I\u2019m still banned from the place ever since I stole a bracelet for my sister\u2019s birthday. Of course that was before we decided that the town was completely off limits.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t really want to hear about how you spoiled your other girlfriend right now. It\u2019s bad enough that continually criticize me and say I\u2019m not as good as sister.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the\u2026first of all I\u2019m sick of these rumors about me and her when it wasn\u2019t even like that! Second of all, I just said ONCE that our capers might run smoother if you had a better array of talents rather than just relying on your looks.\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again putting me down! I don\u2019t see you complaining about my talents when you\u2019re having your five minutes of fun\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow don\u2019t even start with that! Look, I don\u2019t want to fight! Let\u2019s just go get your necklace.\u201d\n\u201cI need more money!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat you gave me isn\u2019t enough for the one I want!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say Jasmine sells cheap quality shit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that old bitch charges an arm and leg for it, so I need more money!\u201d\n\nYou shake your head and reach into your pocket.\n\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine. Here, take it! Take it all!\u201d you exclaim and hand over most of your coins to Annah, who takes them without blinking an eye.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re wondering why if she thinks you\u2019re such a bad bum to her that why is she with you at all.\n\n\u201cThanks baby!\u201d Annah beams and kisses you.\n\nWell that answers your question.\n\nAs Annah grabs your arm while you walk to Jasmine\u2019s shop, you continue to think about leaving here. The only thing is, are you going to do it like your sister did and just leave in the middle of the night, or are you going to actually say goodbye first?\n\nYou sort of think with as much grief as you give your parents, they might actually like to at least say goodbye to you seeing as they didn\u2019t get that chance with your sister.\n\nOf course that might be just wishful thinking on your part.\n\n\u201cOkay, since you said you\u2019re not allowed in, just wait outside and I\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d Annah says as you get to Sparkling Treasures.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d You remark.\n\nAnnah hasn\u2019t been gone long when you encounter more trouble.\n\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t the notorious thief of Teckville. Shouldn\u2019t you be skulking around in the shadows stealing from little old ladies?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Klint and ever since your sister left, he\u2019s been even more of an asshole to you and you\u2019re not really sure why.\n\n\u201cKlint, seriously what the hell is your problem? I don\u2019t understand this continued antagonism towards me. I don\u2019t go over to your family\u2019s chicken farm and steal the cocks out of your hand.\u201d\n\nKlint as usual is slow on the uptake and doesn\u2019t even get the double meaning insult you just said, but he\u2019s mad at you anyway.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s all your fucking fault! I could have gotten with your sister if YOU hadn\u2019t been around!\u201d\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, if my sister had ANY attraction to you, she certainly would have showed it. She didn\u2019t and now she\u2019s GONE, okay? Get the hell over it already\u2026\u201d\n\nKlint at this point starts getting closer to you and raising his voice and you begin to take a more defensive stance.\n\n\u201cFUCK YOU! It was ALL your fault! How could I have a chance with her when YOU corrupted her! Tell me\u2026did she smell like flowers when you embraced her? Did she taste like honey when you kissed her? Did the very heavens move when you plunged into her?\u201d he asks with a mixture of anger and resentment, but also with a glint of eagerness that you\u2019ll tell him.\n\nWhile you knew Klint was always a bit obsessed with your sister, you never quite knew how bad it was until just now. He\u2019s totally lost it.\n\n\u201cKlint, contrary to what the rumors are, none of that happened you sick fuck. Look, just go home before something bad happens\u2026\u201d you say.\n\u201cOh something bad is gonna happen alright sister fucker!\u201d He says and then brandishes a knife partially covered in blood and with a few feathers stuck to it.\n\nAnd of course nobody is around to see all this despite it being broad daylight. Or maybe they\u2019re just watching from windows and don\u2019t care. You\u2019re not exactly popular after all.\n\n\u201cKlint, put that knife back and just walk away now.\u201d You say stepping back.\n\u201cEveryone in this town hates you, y\u2019know. Even that whore you hang around with now. She came on to me the other night saying how she wanted a proper fuck as opposed to your pathetic attempts. I didn\u2019t fuck her though; I just let her suck my dick. Did she kiss you today? Ha ha ha ha!\u201d\n\nYou ignore Klint\u2019s ramblings and continue to focus on his knife, which is now aiming towards your face, even if you are trying to widen the gap between you two.\n\n\u201cKlint, last chance to get that knife out of my face.\u201d\n\u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s a good question, what are you going to do?", "action_results": [null, null]}]}]}
