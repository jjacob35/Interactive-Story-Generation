Do you\u2026\u201d\n\nClick.\n\nYou\u2019re so damn sick of these Ground Zero commercials you think as you turn the TV off. If you older brother Ben hadn\u2019t shot his family and himself in a tragic paranoid breakdown you can only imagine he\u2019d be going on about how right he was in building that underground bunker out in your backyard.\n\nYou look at the time and realize you\u2019ve spent most of the day procrastinating watching TV even though there\u2019s not much on that interests you on TV anymore. All the channels you used to watch that had interesting shit on them now all have shallow reality shows and quite frankly you\u2019ve got enough dysfunctional family drama going on in real life without needing to watch it on TV.\n\nYou remember a time when you could avoid most of the mess by hiding out in your basement. Unfortunately you can\u2019t even do that anymore. Ever since dad drank himself to death, the gravy train of living at home for free came to an end.\n\nWithout the help of your dad\u2019s pension checks anymore, your older Amazonian sister Kelly said there was no way in hell that she was going to keep supporting the house on her own unless she was the only one living in it. Seeing as she\u2019s a roller derby bitch as well as an illegal fight club brawler, it isn\u2019t like you or any of your siblings were in any position to argue with her.\n\nYour younger brother Peter, having given up his lofty dreams of being a famous movie director now spends a lot of his time in the garage making amateur porn with various guys he picks up at the clubs. He makes enough money through his website that it keeps Kelly off his back. He seems to enjoy what he\u2019s doing and at least he\u2019s not stealing your clothes anymore.\n\nYour younger sister Donna simply moved out and moved in with your best friend Julie who is still the eternal party girl. Really you\u2019re surprised Julie hasn\u2019t caught every STD known to man at this point. To be honest Donna\u2019s had more in common with Julie than you have for many years now. You\u2019re sure Donna\u2019s a lot happier at a \u201cparty house.\u201d\n\nAs for you, you didn\u2019t have much in the way of options. Trying to get a job has failed spectacularly in this economy. Though your\u2026\u201dunique\u201d and reclusive personality doesn\u2019t exactly help in that department.\n\nGiven some of the junk that\u2019s laying around the house you sometimes wonder if you shouldn\u2019t try to sell some of it over the Internet to support yourself. Seems like a lot of work though and you\u2019re no wheeler and dealer.\n\nDonna suggested that you move in with her and Julie, but that whole scene isn\u2019t for you. As much as you hate dealing with Kelly, you\u2019d also hate having to put up with drunk horny guys (and girls) trying to get into your pants every five minutes, not to mention the loud music, crowds and the ever growing possibility of the cops busting the place for illegal drugs.\n\nWhich brings you to your boyfriend Bobby Morningstar who naturally has suggested that you move in with him on several occasions. This would be the ideal solution if it weren\u2019t for the fact that his own family consists of like a million siblings that all live in his cult compound. There\u2019s also the fact that his ex-girlfriend/sister Diana is wicked pissed at you for stealing him away from her.\n\nIt\u2019s been an ongoing source of tension between you and Bobby and you wish he\u2019d just leave them all behind and you two could make a life together elsewhere, but his duty to family is strong, as is his faith to the Babylonian Goddess of Chaos, Tiamat which still involves human sacrifices.\n\nRight now you\u2019re having a period of separation with him. Sometimes you think about breaking up with him completely, but then you can\u2019t just dismiss the good times you do have with him. You have that special bond that only a couple could have when one warns the other about their serial killer relative lying in wait for them in the woods. Thank god Bobby took care of your uncle Ed. That had to be the scariest moment of your life dealing with that situation.\n\nOf course none of this delightful recap of past events really helps you. Kelly is starting to get very impatient with you and you fear that your months of stalling are coming to an end.\n\nKelly\u2019s currently not home, but she\u2019ll be back in a few hours to get a bit of sleep before heading off to her fight club stuff. Continuing to enjoy the time you have to not have to deal with her you go back to procrastinating, which mainly involves goofing off on the Internet, \u201cstumbling\u201d upon a porn site and then using battery powered means to relieve yourself of stress.\n\nEventually you hear the familiar slamming of the door and stomping around upstairs, which signifies that Kelly is indeed home.\n\n\u201cSUZY! Stop splittin\u2019 the kitten and get yer bony ass up here!\u201d you hear Kelly shout.\n\nYou were afraid of this. You clean yourself up a bit, mentally prepare yourself and then head upstairs.\n\n\u201cHey Kelly\u2026\u201d you start to say, but are interrupted.\n\u201cShut up. I\u2019ve got exactly a couple hours to get some rest before I have to drag my ass to my other job to support this fucking house and it\u2019s a fucking mess! You can\u2019t even clean up around here? Did you even look for a job today? Let me guess you spent the whole day fucking around on the Internet and masturbating didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell uh...\u201d\n\u201cJesus fuckin\u2019 Christ Suzy, you\u2019re goddamn useless you know that? The only reason I\u2019m not kicking your ass right now is because I need to save my energy and it would be too fucking easy.\u201d\n\nBefore you can even speak, Kelly continues her rant.\n\n\u201cGET A FUCKING JOB! I don\u2019t care what kind! Just be a contributing member of this household like Peter or get the fuck out like Donna!\u201d\n\u201cKelly I\u2019m trying, but I\u2019m just not having any luck in finding anything, can\u2019t you help me out?\u201d you say.\n\u201cHelp you out? I\u2019m helping you out right now by supporting your ass! I\u2019ve been helping you out for quite some time! In fact I originally suggested that you could probably become a ring girl at the fights, but you said no because you didn\u2019t want to dress up in skimpy clothing and parade around in front of a bunch of drunks.\u201d\n\u201cKelly, you know I don\u2019t want to dress like that in public, especially not after what uncle Ed made me wear that night\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh here we go, crazy old uncle Ed! How long you going to keep using that as an excuse? Sheesh, the way you go on about it, you act like he raped you. What happened instead? He got killed, you weren\u2019t even touched and you got a fucking boyfriend out of that deal! Some of us should be so lucky to be in a fucked up situation and STILL come out ahead! You know what I deal with on a regular basis? Steroid freaks trying to break my fucking neck that\u2019s what! You think I\u2019d be making a living trading punches with fucktards if I LOOKED like you Suzy? You got the biggest advantage and you\u2019re just wasting it! What the hell is your goddamn problem?\u201d\n\nYou can see that Kelly is in full-blown jealousy mode and shows no signs of stopping. Attempting to walk away will only result in her getting physical with you so the only thing you can do is endure the verbal assault.\n\n\u201cThis is sink or swim time sis. You either get your shit together by the end of this week or you\u2019re out on your ass! This sheltered girl act is really fucking OLD! You\u2019re a grown ass WOMAN. Start acting like one! Now get out of my fucking sight.\u201d\n\nYou meekly slink back to the basement and leave Kelly alone.\n\nYou silently mope for a while pondering what the hell you\u2019re going to do next. You then notice that your phone has been under your couch cushions and on silent all day. Bobby apparently has been repeatedly trying to contact you. Even left multiple texts saying that he really wants to talk, but the mood you\u2019re in right now, you don\u2019t want to deal with it.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to deal with anything. You just want to be safe in your own little world in the basement. How you miss those days\u2026\n\nWell today isn\u2019t completely over yet. You\u2019ve still got time to salvage some of it. Hell, maybe you can even make a major change in your life.", "action_results": [{"action": "Get help from Peter", "result": "You don\u2019t want to move out and you can\u2019t trust yourself to not get distracted as usual trying to find a job. You need help and the only other person you know that has one in the house is Peter, so you decide to go see him and hope he isn\u2019t in the middle of \u201cworking.\u201d\n\nYou head to the garage and knock on the door. From within you hear a come on in so you do so, unfortunately given Peter\u2019s state of near nakedness and a tube of KY in hand its obvious he wasn\u2019t expecting you.\n\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s you. What do you want? I got a couple of guys coming over soon and I still need to lube up.\u201d he says\n\u201cUgh\u2026I need to speak to you.\u201d You say trying not to look at him. \u201cCan you put some damn clothes on?\u201d\n\u201c(Sigh) Fine, but let\u2019s hurry this up.\u201d Peter says and puts on a robe.\n\n\u201cPeter, I need your help in finding a job and before you even suggest it, no I\u2019m not going to do what you do for money.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course not. Wouldn\u2019t enter my mind to suggest such a thing to the likes of you. Which means I don\u2019t have many other suggestions for you. I mean I can only imagine you\u2019ve failed horribly at getting a normal job due to your lack of a college degree, personality quirks and crippling introversion. You don\u2019t seem to have the motivation to start your own business and for some baffling reason you don\u2019t even take advantage of the natural gifts you do have. Pfft, if I was you, I\u2019d start now because you\u2019re just getting older.\u201d\n\u201cPeter, I\u2019m not a whore. I\u2019m not going to just spread my legs to everyone for cash.\u201d\n\u201cWho said everyone? Just get one rich one, shit shouldn\u2019t be that hard for you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who I am, besides I have a boyfriend\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho? Bobby? I thought you two broke up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, well sort of\u2026it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cWell then you need to work something out with him then and let him take care of you because while I didn\u2019t hear the whole rant, Kelly was loud enough that I made out some of it even from here. Sounds like she gave you an ultimatum.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d You say slumping into a nearby chair.\n\nPeter and you have never been close and most of the time he\u2019s annoyed you by constantly stealing your clothes in the past, but to his credit he go over and tries to console you a bit with a hug, given that his dick is still swinging out of his robe, you\u2019d rather he didn\u2019t and politely tell him you\u2019re fine.\n\n\u201cHave you tried the circus?\u201d Peter suddenly asks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you respond.\n\u201cThe circus. There\u2019s a small one set up a few miles west outside of town. Almost like a gypsy camp really. Remember how our family used to go together? I think it\u2019s about the only time we all got along.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026I always liked the clowns the most. I liked how outgoing and happy they always were. Even thought I\u2019d grow up and be one at one point.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I think you were the only one as far as that went. I still remember you used to paint up your face with mom\u2019s make up and try to entertain Donna and me at home. Though to be quite honest all you did was scare the hell out of us.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s why I gave up that dream. Figured I was doing it wrong.\u201d You say gloomily.\n\u201cOh. Sorry about that, didn\u2019t mean to be a dream crusher.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, given my introversion I doubt if I would\u2019ve been able to actually get in front of a crowd and do it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cHey, you shouldn\u2019t have given up if that was what you wanted to do. I mean maybe you should pursue it now. I mean you don\u2019t have much to lose right and how hard could it be? Put on make up, dress up silly, and generally act creepy\u2026erm I mean goofy.\u201d\n\nPeter\u2019s words do light a certain spark in you.\n\n\u201cHmmm, maybe you\u2019re right\u2026I\u2019ll do it!\u201d you suddenly exclaim.\n\u201cGood, glad to hear you\u2019re excited about something. So are you good now? I mean I\u2019d talk more, but y\u2019know still got guys coming over and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh right, yeah I\u2019m good. Hold on, can I borrow your car to get to the circus tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cUhhh, yeah sure. Keys are over there.\u201d\n\u201cThanks again Peter.\u201d You say taking the keys and leave.\n\nYou head back down to the basement filled with excitement at the prospect of pursuing your childhood dream again! It all seems a little crazy right now, but the more you think about it the more it makes sense.\n\nYou spend the rest of the night in good spirits and maintain a positive attitude that everything will be okay tomorrow.", "action_results": [null]}]}
