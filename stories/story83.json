It was right by the motorbike that your friend was about to show off.\n\nYou didn't really think much of it, not even asking your friend about it at first since it was probably your eyes just playing tricks on you, it was pretty dim after all.\n\nIt was wasn't until you got closer.\n\nThe facial features, the blood, the bent limbs and the wriggling maggots that were feasting around its mouth and what was left of its nose.\n\nYou don't remember all that much after that.\n\nYour dad told you that you had to be sent home since you wouldn't stop screaming or crying, when he reminisced the story to you he found it amusing.\n\nKnowing what you do know, you didn't find it funny.\n\nYou didn't really fear it all that much either though.", "action_results": [{"action": "Present day", "result": "There seemed to be a difference in the dead you saw.\n\nSome were alive and could communicate with you, while others were just corpses that you would see as if the crime or accident had just happened, sometimes the corpses would seem very decayed too, just like the one at your friend's house.\n\nAt first, it was just it was just corpses that you were able to see, which really fucked you up when you saw them every now and then at different locations whenever you left you left your house. The first times you screamed, as far you can remember or have been told by your parents, but soon it seems you just got used to it as no one else were able to see what you kept on seeing. It didn't scare you as it did the first times after encountering new corpses, but then again it wasn't a sight that you looked forward to seeing either.\n\nYou could best describe it as getting sick, or getting injured. It sucks when it happens, but you can't really do all that much about it, and the only way around it is to limit yourself in the locations that you went. That's how you ended up becoming a shut-in, locked away in your room on your computer for whenever you came home from school or had free time on the weekends.\n\nThat's to say you weren't an emo loner or someone who had terrible serious issues that needed therapy, or at least you hoped so.\n\nThe screaming parts were just seen as a phase to your parents. Like sex or bad words, seeing dead people was something that you never really felt comfortable talking about with them.\n\nIn fact, at first, you thought everyone could see it, and they were just fucking with you when they said that they had no idea what you were talking about when you pointed at the corpses. It took months before you knew that it was just your own personal disease.\n\nA disease that you knew would probably never get cured.\n\nWaking up from bed, in a tired daze, you looked at your phone to see that it was Friday, and you had woken up an hour early before school. This was pretty unusual, since most of the time you would stay up till one or two a.m. and would usually miss the morning bus.\n\nThat had to mean you only got like four or five hours of sleep.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nTaking the time that you had, you got yourself showered and dressed and went downstairs to make yourself some breakfast before you would walk to your bus stop.\n\nYour school was close enough that walking could be an option.\n\nAlthough usually, you run into a few car crash victims along the sidewalk, most of the time their heavily disfigured or heavily weeping.\n\nYou don't know exactly why you didn't notice them when you were younger, though you chalked it up to the assumption that you were always playing on your Gameboy on car rides or something.\n\nThere have been a few instances in which you've spoken to the dead, although most of the time they never ended well.\n\nIt seems that they're trapped into a sort of box, each box differentiating in size to reasons unknown to you. If they're lucky they have someone to talk to if the place they died has another ghost, or they died in pairs. When there's a lone ghost, however, most of the time they look miserable or heavily distressed.\n\nYou learned never to make eye contact, as that was a sure fire way that they knew that you could see them. There was one time that one on a road you traveled on was screaming at you, and that had caused other ghosts in the area to also look over at you as he screamed that you could see him.\n\nYou don't ever go on that road now on the way home, in fact, you stay try your best to stay away from that part of the city.\n\nThough there a bit of you that was ashamed for being afraid of ghosts. If this was something you were going to live with for the rest of your life then you had to start facing it head on, or at least that's what you wanted to think.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}
