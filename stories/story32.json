Looking on, the saffron-haired goddess could feel a distinct sense of inspiration come over her. Their lithe movements, and Dwynen's elegant aerial dance, inspired such excitement to rise up in her that her hair seemed to truly be aflame. Watching intently, she reached for her hair and pulled away a handful of burning strands which she began to fashion into the shape of a faery \u2013 yet larger by far than any of Dwynen\u2019s pixie kind; indeed, what she shaped was easily three feet tall, and the span of each of its wings twice that. Her skin was blue and her eyes gold, and she looked at the goddess with clear animosity.\n\nThe goddess frowned. \u201cWell, that came out wro-\u201d but before she could wipe the angry thing away, the blue-skinned fae spread her wings and rose, and in her wake there scattered a thousand smaller fae of complexions blue and green and yellow and purple, turning their heads frantically here and there with clear mischief in mind. \u201cThere's no taking Asula back!\u201d Said the mother-fae. A few of her children attacked poor Dwynen, and others yet pulled at the hair the the island folk, who cried out in shock and distress \u2013 for they had never been subjected to this kind of treatment and had not thought it possible.\n\nIrritated, the saffron-haired goddess caught one of the fae and shook it till it was dust, then pounced upon another and did the same. But the air all around was swarming with them, and many had flown far away \u2013 that Asula was long gone and was leaving newborns in her wake.\n\nGathering the dust of all those she had slain, and throwing in her crimson hair, the goddess created once more. There arose another, of similar height but powerfully built and wingless, a clear warrior. He was horribly pale and his hair was all wrong \u2013 devoid of life and colour. And above him, yet another rose \u2013 a woman winged -, and another.\n\n\u201cBrentylwith arises!\u201d Declared the pale wingless male.\n\n\u201cEirgwyn takes flight!\u201d The first female announced.\n\n\u201cDichdorka ascends!\u201d The second female proclaimed.\n\nAnd as with Asula, in the wake of these latter two erupted more fae, seemingly more benign than Asula's, and they immediately set about tugging their blue- and green- and purple-skinned kin off the island folk, and freed poor Dwynen. But these new fae had not the strength or martial prowess of their firstborn cousins and were immediately set upon. Only the intervention of the larger three tipped the balance, and even then only slightly. And so the goddess fashioned a blade and summoned the wingless warrior to her (who, though wingless, flew just as easily as the rest) and she handed it to him. And immediately he was filled with its power and was made mighty. For in his grasp was the First Warsword; Seihdhos Sword of Victory.\n\nAnd the Sullied fae scattered, and the wingless warrior gathered his Unsullied kin and gave chase. Wherever Asula and the Sullied went, they spread mayhem and chaos, ranging from the slightly mischievous to the downright cruel, and wherever the Unsullied came they spread seeds and great forests grew all over the world, and streams exploded from the earth and gushed forth to the sea. And the fae clashed and battled \u2013 in the skies and in the deep dark forests, in streams and in lakes and atop the mountains and the hills. They burst across the world, warring and fighting as they went, and the terrifying power of the First Warsword was made manifest again and again. Even now it struck down one unfortunate Sullied or another, cleaving them in twain and causing them to burst into a great cloud of magick and dust.\n\nThe saffron-haired goddess looked on this penitently and with great contriteness, and she was majorly conscious-stricken and guilt-ridden. \u201cWhoops.\u201d She woefully said.\n\nNow as the saffron-haired goddess stood there, a sudden nausea took her. She called her precious Dwynen to her and splashed into the sea, leaving the singing island behind her and sinking beneath the waves. Dwynen fluttered above the water, trying to keep the Flame-haired goddess in sight. But it was no use, and her efforts were swiftly cut short as a Sullied suddenly swooped upon her, caught her, and flew away laughing and cackling.\n\nThe goddess noticed Dwynen's plight, distantly, and thought to help. But her body felt heavy and the feeling of being afloat in the water, being carried away and cushioned without any effort and without any part of her body being overburdened, was serene. She could feel it now \u2013 the reason for her heaviness. Her bloating belly. She laughed inwardly \u2013 it was only natural that a such a worthy sword should make her bloom. But with what \u2013 residue? Too tame! And yet here she was with a life growing within her. A boy, she knew, and smiled as she whispered his name in the water. \u201cBrahun Dan.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "But the Crimson Goddess was not the only divine, and just as there are Sullied Fae, so too are there Sullied Gods. The One Who Mars (Mar to his non-existent friends), who dwells inside Mount Blight in the Heights of Utter Villainy, was one such divine, and he soon set his eyes on the Unsullied Court at the Heights of Utter Villainy. But for what reason, pray tell?\n\nHe set out searching through the mountains, by the rivers, in the woods until- aha! He found what he was searching for. They shrank away in fear before him, and the very sight of him had already marred their day. These little creatures had infringed upon his domain uninvited, setting up this Court of theirs. They were asking for it.\n\n\u201cWh- who are you?\u201d One asked.\n\n\n\u201cNo Hawthorn, don\u2019t talk to i-\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the One Who Mars.\u201d The god declared with dread horror. \u201cMar to my non-existent friends.\u201d\n\nThen he snatched up the one who asked, smashed (nearly) all the others into golden dust, and carried this Hawthorn off with him to the Heights of Utter Villainy, right into the depths of Mount Blight. There he set about torturing the poor little thing, because that\u2019s what terrible dark gods do. And once he was done with that, he got to the purpose and Marred the little fae. He was not satisfied, after all, with the great monstrosities he had already made, and when the shadowy fae was complete he was pleased.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d he commanded his other monsters, \u201cand bring them all to me to be marred!\u201d Because that is what anyone whose name is quite literally Mar does.", "action_results": [{"action": "Meanwhile elsewhere...", "result": "\u201cYou must beware, you must beware,\u201d said the purple-headed man, \u201cthe One Who Eats is everywhere!\u201d They had thought him an odd giant, with his purple head and the strange object he balanced on his head.

He ate the Lord, and he ate the Lady, and he ate quite a lot of fae. But the ones who he did not eat were so afraid that they were willing to do just about anything to avoid the horrid fate of being in his belly forever. He told them to bring him lots of food as tribute, and to house him in a great temple. \u201cAnd if I see you shirking, and if you try to flee,\u201d he warned, \u201cthen I will find you, and I will gobble you right up.\u201d And so the poor fae of the Unsullied Court at the Chomp-Munch Plain got to work.\n\nNow the One Who Eats was as greedy as he was gluttonous, and he worried that someone truly powerful might try to come along and ruin the good thing he had going for himself, with plenty of slaves to do all the hard work and bring him all the food he wanted. So he got to thinking \u2013 and when losing his eternal feast was at stake, he could really think. He thought for a long time, his face all scrunched up, and his eyebrows were all furrowed and even his stomach seemed all frowny- and thinky-faced until-\n\nAha! He had a great idea.

And so he relented in his crusade and, after considering the plight of those at the those at the Crunch-Munch Plain, decided that the former case was more pressing.

So go ye forth to the trees and take from them branches, and I would have you sharpen them on stones.\u201d And with this, Brentylwith armed his people with sharpened staves, and when next they met a monstrous kidnapper \u2013 or Marigs, as the Unsullied had taken to calling them \u2013 the hated creature was pierced by thousands of little spears and leaked its green, toxic blood.

She was about to approach the tree\u2019s trunk for inspection when her head snapped to the side and she felt it. In the distance: war and the scent of swords about to be drawn.\n\nThe goddess drew deeper into Mar\u2019s domain and soon came upon a small host of Unsullied, with little makeshift spears in their hands, struggling with one of Mar's monstrosities. \u201cTingalina! From the side!\u201d One was shouting.\n\n\u201cIts eye! Get its eye!\u201d But even with their weapons, they were clearly outmatched and soon the hundred or so Unsullied made to escape.

The Marig croaked something unintelligible and shrunk back, and the goddess let it go and watched it flee.\n\nCheering, the Unsullied host surrounded the goddess and, all of them carrying her, took her back to Elabeen and Fylmira. The Lord and Lady immediately recognised the goddess and told her of their plight, and how even with the aid of mighty Brentylwith they suffered at the hands of the Marig.\n\n\u201cAnd where is Brentylwith?\u201d The goddess asked.\n\n\u201cHe ventured forth at dawn and we have not seen him since.

But the skills of a warrior are not enough, for warriors must organise themselves well to succeed and attain victory in the fray.\u201d And the goddess approached Elabeen and Fylmira and taught them these things, and she taught them to many others too.\n\nThen she left and continued her search for her stolen Dwynen.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "\u201cI knew that damn red slut was involved in this!

She immediately noticed that one of them had stunning red hair! And so the goddess descended quickly to see who it could possibly be \u2013 an admirer of hers, perhaps? The other figure, she soon realised, was none other than Brentylwith. Seihdhos was unsheathed in his hand and a host of some ten Unsullied stood at his back.\n\nSpotting the goddess, Brentylwith opened his mouth to greet his creator, but the shout of the other over-rode him completely.\n\n\u201cMother!\u201d cried the pale, red-haired humanoid. The goddess looked at her more closely and frowned, for this carapaced warrior-woman had hair as red and thick as her own, and yet she did not remember creating or mothering her. \u201cMother, it\u2019s me,\u201d the pale woman stepped towards the saffron-haired goddess, sheathing the sword she had been holding extended towards Brentylwith the King.\n\n\u201cI am mother to many things. Are you a fae of some kind? Where are your wings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I am no faery. It's me, Newygnong. I have become beautiful \u2013 like you.\u201d The pale one smiled and the goddess\u2019 eyes widened. She approached the woman, stroking her face admiringly.\n\n\u201cWow, Newy! You've really changed. How in the world did you go from giant millipede to this?\u201d Newygnong beamed at the goddess\u2019 clear approval for her new form.\n\n\u201cDo you love me now? Will you be my mother?\u201d The goddess cocked her head in confusion.\n\n\u201cWhat in the world do you mean, Newy? I've always loved you \u2013 but your mammeh (and pappeh) is that piggish eater, not me.\u201d Newygnong's face fell and she frowned.\n\n\u201cB- but\u2026 I \u2026 \u201d she paused, \u201cwhy can't you be my mother? When I was ever-hungry you soothed me\u2026 and when I was ugly, you were the beauty I aspired towards\u2026 and when my mind was frail you, you gave me reason\u2026 why can't you be my mother?\u201d The goddess pursed her lips and considered Newygnong, stroking her hair gently. But before the goddess could respond, Brentylwith spoke.\n\n\u201cMighty Flame-haired goddess. Do you know this one?\u201d Newygnong looked to Brentylwith and placed her hand upon her sword pommel guardedly. The goddess turned to the Unsullied King and nodded.\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s mine.\u201d Newygnong's eyes widened at the odd wording and then she flushed and began mumbling unintelligibly. Brentylwith raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cI have drawn my sword, Flame-haired one, and I refuse to sheathe it before the blood of the one who forced me do so wets it.\u201d The goddess shook her head at these words.\n\n\u201cNow that's a bit extreme I'd say. Whatever's got you two at each other's necks?\u201d It was Newygnong who responded.\n\n\u201cWe crossed paths and, instead of ignoring me and going on his little way like any normal person, he chose to accost me with his sword and demand I identify myself. I did not at all like the way he addressed me and naturally refused to do anything he asked of me. Then he began swinging that sword of his about and, well, here we are.\u201d Brentylwith scoffed at the carapaced woman\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cFor all I knew you were an enemy, it is only natural that I would stop and question you. If you truly meant no ill, you would have had the common courtesy of complying and making clear that you are no foe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad you not made your hostility so abundantly clear, I would have given you no reason to think me a foe,\u201d Newygnong retorted with a scowl. The goddess chuckled at their childish spat.\n\n\u201cAlright alright, I get it. Stop bickering will you, you're like a married couple already,\u201d the two glanced at the goddess in confusion, manifestly ignorant of what this \u2018married couple\u2019 was, but the goddess continued without pause, \u201cthere's no need to kill over a silly misunderstanding like this. Here, to settle this issue \u2013 since you both clearly need to get some of that sexual tension out of your system \u2013, you can duel until one or the other surrenders.\u201d Newygnong and Brentylwith continued to stare with confusion, so she explained. \u201cYou fight one another. But not to the death, don\u2019t get overexcited now. When one of you emerges as the clear victor, by disarming the other or drawing first blood, the duel is done. Simple right?\u201d Newygnong and Brentylwith eyed one another carefully for a few moments, and then Newygnong nodded in understanding and was followed by the Unsullied King. \u201cAnd stay inside this ring. If one of you steps or is forced out of it, they lose.\u201d A large ring with a diameter of some ten metres appeared on the ground around them in glowing orange.\n\nThe King and his carapaced opponent immediately began circling each other, Newygnong slowly drawing her sword. The goddess immediately knew it to be of her son\u2019s making \u2013 such was the motherly instinct \u2013 and wondered what Brahun Dan had been up to since she birthed him in the ocean and watched him rush off into the world. As the goddess watched, Brentylwith took a single step forward before suddenly leaping forth at immense speed, swinging Seihdhos downwards in a mighty slash. The lithe Newygnong saw him, however, and sidestepped quite easily with an equally swift yet strikingly graceful movement and made to slice her opponent. But the very earth where Seihdhos landed erupted in a mighty cacophony and broke away, leaving a large crater and forcing the pale Newygnong to leap away from the area of damage. She frowned and gave the Unsullied King's sword a perturbed look, as if reassessing how to go about this.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that Brentylwith had no intention of giving her much time to think, for he leapt at her once more, this time powerfully swinging his sword in a horizontal arc. Newygnong brought her sword up and, bracing herself, met the King's strike head-on. The two blades clanked resoundingly one upon the other\u2026 an ear-piercing screech sounded even before the blades touched, and at the very moment of contact (the swords touched only for a split-second) both Brentylwith and Newygnong were violently blown away like mere ragdolls. The entire duelling ring was rent asunder, dust and earth exploded into the air, and the two duellists landed some hundred metres apart (Brentylwith crashing into a number of his warriors and taking them with him).\n\nThrough the dust and falling debris came the slow sound of clapping, and the burning hair of the Flame-haired goddess shone bright even through the thick dust. And when the dust settled, the goddess was gone. Brentylwith floated to his feet and looked through the haze \u2013 for their clash had left the ground, and very air, searingly hot \u2013 to where his opponent had been. The red-haired Newygnong flew through the heat and landed some distance from him. Brentylwith raised a hand and sheathed his sword.\n\n\u201cPeace, Newygnong, our duel is ended. You are clearly blessed by the gods.\u201d Newygnong did not smile, but nodded and sheathed her own blade.\n\n\u201cAnd it would appear that you are likewise blessed. Did Brahun Dan craft your sword also?\u201d Brentylwith frowned and shook his head.\n\n\u201cNo, this is Seihdhos Sword of Victory, the First Warsword. It was crafted by the Crimson Goddess.\u201d Newygnong raised her eyebrows in surprise and looked to Seihdhos with sudden interest. \u201cWho is this Brahun Dan that you make mention of? I take it she crafted your sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrahun Dan is my brother. He is the son of the Flame-haired goddess. And yes, he gifted me with Purity. Purity is not merely a sword \u2013 it is a living, speaking sword. But I have yet to hear it speak.\u201d Brentylwith approached Newygnong and inspected her more carefully. Her lithe and graceful movements during their fight had surprised him and made him very suddenly aware of her femininity. Her pale face looked like it had been chiselled of snow, her black lips small yet full, and seemingly ever-pursed in a disapproving straight line.\n\n\u201cAre you certain you are not a faery?\u201d Brentylwith asked, hovering so that he was face-level with her as he continued inspecting her features.\n\n\u201cNo, I am certifiably not a faery. Until very recently, I was a giant bug actually.\u201d Brentylwith grimaced and backed away somewhat.\n\n\u201cAh, I see. Well. You have done a rather good job on yourself. Why, you are as pretty as any one of the Unsullied Queens.\u201d Newygnong blinked at the sudden compliment and attempted to mutter a thank you, but Brentylwith continued, \u201cand you are mighty in the fray, so much is clear. Newygnong the fiery-haired warrioress, daughter of the Flame-haired goddess, wielder of Purity the Livingsword, will you not forever honour me by joining me in the defence of my people?\u201d\n\nNewygnong considered the Unsullied King for a few moments. \u201cIs it Mar that is attacking you?\u201d Brentylwith's brows furrowed and he nodded.\n\n\u201cWe fight the Marig \u2013 hideous beings that kidnap our people and take them into the heart of the mountain.\u201d And Brentylwith gestured towards Mount Blight, where Newygnong knew Mar had his lair. She nodded in understanding.\n\n\u201cIf it is Mar you fight, then your request is granted, Brentylwith the King, for your foe and my foe is one.\u201d The Unsullied King beamed at her words and, approaching her swiftly, placed a hand upon her nose.\n\n\u201cYou speak so seriously. Are you made of stone?\u201d Newygnong pursed her lips more tightly and moved her face away from the little man, \u201cand yet your very frowns are fairer far than smiles of other maidens are!\u201d Newygnong batted him away quickly, her pale cheeks reddening ever so slightly.\n\n\u201cAre- are you- what are you even- faeries don't even-\u201d realising that she was jabbering, she quickly closed her mouth and huffed. \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Brenylwith the King only laughed.\n\n\u201cCome with me, deadly beauty, for there is a war to be won!\u201d The King declared as he leapt high into the air and dashed away, followed by his entourage. Newygnong watched him go for a few moments before she too lifted off from the ground and leapt after him.", "action_results": [{"action": "To war!", "result": "It was a quiet day. With the Marig gone, and no more fae being taken, an eerie silence washed over the Heights of Utter Villainy, not helped by a thick layer of fog that wafted through the untouched forests of the Unsullied.\n\nAnd through that fog, and through the trees, came Brentylwith the King and his airborne army of five-thousand, and through that fog came Newygnong leading the way forth on land, five-thousand at her back and Purity severing the tension before her. One faery, flying high above the forces of the Unsullied, raised a conch to her lips and blew, and below the thousands of warriors massed into formations, Brentylwith's commands booming unnaturally loud. Faeries dashed to the King, notifying him of swarms of a strange new enemy spotted directly north of them and of another swarm to the north-west. The King sent to Newygnong, bidding her direct her land forces to the north to face the enemy there. And with Seihdhos raised high, the airborne Unsullied horde followed its King.\n\nThe earth shook beneath the feet of Newygnong's regiments, their spears pounding the ground and wickerwork shields brought close. Soon enough the swarming horde of strange dark creatures came into sight, and there was no doubt in Newygnong's mind that they were utter and absolute killjoys. Very much unlike her. Sending a fleet messenger to inform the King of this \u2013 so that all doubt about the nature of these swarms would be known \u2013 she had her newly formed army prepare to take on the enemy. Some fifty Eshgaebars with elaborate leafy crowns shouted out orders to their companies as small messenger faeries rushed from Newygnong to them and conches were blown to bring the entire army to battle readiness.\n\nIn the distance, the shadowy fae came. Some ran like animals on the ground, with no signs of stopping or slowing down. Growling, snarling, and howling like mere beasts, these wild ones charged forth. They came in many different sizes, from small little menaces to hulking monstrosities that nearly matched the Marigs in size. Nearly all of them boasted claws, talons, fangs, and an assortment of other dangerous body parts.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, were not quite so animalistic. They retained a semblance of intelligence and organisation, but here too were razor claws and talons, and elongated fangs, to be seen. And as they approached, they released songs and hymns with voices that sounded vaguely like those of who they were before they were taken and utterly marred.\n\nThe familiar sounds alarmed the gathered Unsullied, warriors looked to one another in fear. But Newygnong, who felt their fear, stepped forth and delivered a bloodcurdling cry. And even before their eyes the beautiful yet deadly commander morphed into a horrifying beast, a giant humanoid insect with a great tail and many arms. Purity raised high, she turned to them and cried \u2013 \u201cFollow me, and let them taste our unmarred fury!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the great, humanoid insect of war rushed ahead. So unnerved by their strange commander that their fear at hearing the cries of their brethren was forgotten, the Eshgaebars released their warcries and bid their companies charge. And as one, the Unsullied host rushed forth to meet their Marred former comrades.\n\nThe flooding Marred collided with the charging Unsullied host like waves crashing upon stone. The Marred looked upon the insect beast with the gleaming sword, and hissed. Such a creature they had not been expecting. The wild, animalistic ones, meanwhile, paid Newygnong no heed and fought violently against the Unsullied, biting at any openings found, and clawing upon shields and skin. They fought till they could no longer move, turning to black dust as they passed. Their giant counterparts fared better and targeted Newygnong. In the sky, meanwhile, was a great confrontation between those taking flight. Marred and Unsullied dashed swiftly about, small explosions of dust erupting throughout the aerial battlefield as now Marred and now Unsullied passed violently into ash.\n\nFrom above, there were those that pelted Newygnong with stolen weapons and their own strange energies, which could just about mar any good occasion. That was Mar\u2019s speciality, after all. Newygnong's screeches sounded even over the din of battle, her bony tale snaking out at terrific speeds and spearing Marred fae in her vicinity. Her various arms batted them from existence with impunity while Purity cleft them into clouds of dust away. All around her was black mist through which she strode as if to teach the meaning of true terror and misery to those who erroneously and naively thought they embodied it.\n\nSpear-wielding Unsullied companies, encouraged and directed by their commanding Eshgaebars, raised their shields and tore at their foes, and in the air the shouts of the leaf-crowned commanders provided a semblance of order in a world of utter chaos. \u201cShields!\u201d here sounded and, \u201cSPEARS!\u201d was the cry there. Small beasts of shadow tore at the shields and were swiftly speared with eagle-eyed precision before others took their place. Shields were torn and spears broken, and Unsullied warrior took on Marred fae in barehanded combat \u2013 the warrior chafing beneath the pure strength of these Marred beings. And when a company found itself faced with one of the larger Marred creatures, spears came up and they attacked en masse \u2013 warriors were flung like ragdolls here and there before the brute strength of the beast, but even so did spears strike true.\n\nEshgaebar Tingalina, spear in hand, directed her airborne company at a group of massing Marred Unsullied who seemed to be focussing their attacks against the mighty Newygnong, flinging looted weapons at the commander \u2013 who either cleft them before they reached her with tail or sword, or caught them in mid-air before flinging them back. \u201cAt them!\u201d Tingalina cried, and the company arced in the air \u2013 keeping its formation \u2013 and slammed into the enemy from above and fought them to the ground. The ground was strewn with black and gold dust, and in the air and on the winds the dust of former fae was borne.\n\nA few Marred broke away from the battle, gaining height and surveying the chaos below. It was clear to them that they could not hold out against the Unsullied, for they now had a mastery over warfare that they didn\u2019t possess before. And the strange insect warrior had not been expected. It seemed to have no weakness. With defeat certain, these Marred screeched, and their fae began to fall back. They did not attempt to carry off the wounded, for they would be a burden. They withdrew in anger, cursing the Unsullied and their insect commander and pledging vengeance. Though the battle was lost, the war was far from over.\n\nAs the enemy force made its escape, Newygnong\u2019s army gathered about her and the dread commander morphed back into her feminine carapaced form. She turned to her warriors and, raising Purity high, gave a victorious shout. Her warriors raised their spears and echoed their commander\u2019s cry, and they hammered with the butts of their spears at the earth. Then Newygnong leapt into the air and dashed across the heavens, her host following close behind as they all rushed to aid Brentylwith the King.\n\nWhen Newygnong arrived with her somewhat reduced army, she found the King engaged in battle with the other swarm of Marred fae. The King could clearly be seen, flanked by his warriors, swinging Seihdhos about with skill, sending forth before him a great pillar of black dust. Airborne Unsullied regiments clashed with Marred, and the giant creatures of darkness down on the ground swung their great arms about and flattened dozens of Unsullied warriors with the one movement. And yet the warriors held, and on the coming of Newygnong's army Mar's swarm knew that it had no hope of victory and the cry went up for a retreat. Bit by bit the Marred began to disentangle themselves from the fray.\n\nNewygnong made to give chase with her warriors, but the King's conch sounded, and all troops descended to the ground and formed up in their various regiments before him. Seihdhos in hand, the Unsullied King flew here and there gesturing to the fleeing enemy.\n\n\u201cThey are brought low and humiliation is their lot!\u201d He declared, and the troops slammed their spears into the ground in approval. \u201cBefore the might of the warriors the Unsullied race, they have no hope! Never again will our brethren be taken from us! NEVER AGAIN WILL THEY BE SULLIED SO!\u201d The cry of the troops went up, \u201cand we will end their misery on the field, and they will re-emerge from death and join us anew! And they- will be- UNSULLIED!\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "UNSULLIED!", "result": "Eshgaebar Tingalina lay in the branches of the tree, her spear hanging from her hand as she looked up into the night sky through the fog. The golden-haired faery fiddled with the crown of leaves that adorned her head. It marked her out as an Eshgaebar, commander of a fae company of one-hundred warriors. When selecting who was worthy of being appointed to the position, the King and his commander, the strange Newygnong, had consulted long with the Lord Elabeen and Lady Fylmira. And Tingalina had been amongst the first to be selected.\n\n\u201cTingalina was one of the first to witness the attacks \u2013 she fought to protect her beloved Hawthorn, and was injured and hurt, but still managed to return and warn us of the impending threat. And she has since led groups of faeries deep into the mountains in search of Hawthorn, and has been the cause of much pain to the hated Marig.\u201d Elabeen had told the King. And Newygnong herself had summoned Tingalina and, morphing so her form was closer to the size of the little faery, tested her martial skills until she was satisfied that Tingalina was indeed a warrioress of some standing.\n\nAnd in the first true battle with those Marred fae, Tingalina had fought and killed faeries whose voices and faces \u2013 and whose eyes \u2013 she thought she recognised. And in her heart of hearts she feared that Hawthorn had met the awful fate of becoming one of those\u2026 things. The thought brought her no comfort at all, and only caused tears to well up in her eyes. She stood up and looked into the distance, her small childish form now rippling with strength and her once-innocent face betraying the horrors she had seen. She was no longer simply an Unsullied \u2013 she was a warrioress. A soldier. The small spear in her hand was held in a grip now familiar with it, and her fingers were now calloused and scarred. Bringing her hardened fingertips to her cheek, she wondered if Newygnong would teach her how to make her body soft and beautiful again, and she wondered if somewhere in the far-off mountains Hawthorn waited on her to come and save him.\n\nGripping her spear and unfurling her wings, the faery flew up high until she was above the mists. There she raised her voice and shouted long, and she thought her cry reached the heavens and echoed through the mountains. And her cry was Hawthorn.\n\nBut her cry echoed below also, and Newygnong heard her. The crimson-haired wielder of Purity found the little faery above the fog and joined her. There were tears in the faery's eyes, and Newygnong instinctively raised a carapaced hand \u2013 the protective shell morphing away to reveal a pale white one below \u2013 and wiped the tears from Tingalina's eyes. The faery seemed stunned and raised a hand to touch Newygnong's pale limb. It was incredibly soft. It was also cool.\n\n\u201cWhy are you crying, Eshgaebar?\u201d The red-haired warrioress asked. Tingalina did not let go of Newygnong\u2019s hand as she brought it down. The faery looked off towards the mountains and considered how to respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 had a good friend.\u201d Newygnong looked off towards the mountains too. \u201cHe\u2019s been gone a long time now and\u2026 after what we saw, those creatures\u2026 I\u2019m worried.\u201d There was silence for a time between them as Tingalina stroked Newygnong\u2019s hand, \u201cif\u2026 if Hawthorn has become like them\u2026 is there a way to cure him?\u201d Newygnong did not respond, causing Tingalina to look at her. Silently, Newygnong brought the little fairy into an embrace and stroked her golden locks.\n\n\u201cIf there is a way, we will find it.\u201d She said at last. The childlike faery held onto Newygnong's hard carapace and was filled with wonder.\n\n\u201cHow is it that your shell is so hard yet your hands,\u201d and the faery grasped Newygnong's pale hand once more, \u201cis so soft? And your face.\u201d She placed a tiny finger onto Newygnong's cheek, finding it just as cool and soft as the hand. Newygnong shrugged.\n\n\u201cI guess I just happened that way.\u201d Tingalina cocked her head at this odd response, \u201cI mean, I wasn't always this way. When I was first born I was\u2026 well. I guess it would be easier to show you, would it not?\u201d And before Tingalina's eyes the red-haired warrioress grew into an enormous worm-like creature with a carapace of dark blue and mandibles as long and sharp as blades. \u201cBut I did not like it, and I willed I be otherwise,\u201d and once more Newygnong morphed and became a smaller, stockier insectoid \u2013 yet still a giant to the little Tingalina. \u201cAnd then my brother came and helped me, and he made me beautiful.\u201d And Newygnong was once more her beautiful red-haired self.\n\n\u201cSo under this black shell,\u201d Tingalina touched Newygnong's carapaced chest, \u201cyou are\u2026 all snowy and soft?\u201d Newygnong smiled shyly and looked away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked, so I don't know. But I would think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you just\u2026 will yourself to change form? Can you become anything at all?\u201d Newygnong thought on it for a few moments.\n\n\u201cI am pretty good at it, so I guess anything that I put my mind to, yes.\u201d Tingalina smiled mischievously at this.\n\n\u201cSo can you grow two heads?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and two hands to whack you with,\u201d and Newygnong thwacked the Eshgaebar (lightly, mind you) on the head.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "In the days after that first engagement with their Marred brethren, the warrior-fae of the Unsullied Court at the Heights of Utter Villainy battled again and yet again with the strange Marred beings. They were smaller engagements, it was true (for the Marred had taken care not to attack the Unsullied in large numbers, realising their inability to face them on the field), but they were opportunities for the Unsullied to cement their tactics and see the training and knowledge their troops received bolstered by true battle experience. And behind the strange wall of fog that covered their forest, they were safe.\n\nEshgaebar Tingalina had personally led her loyal one-hundred in various raids into the mountains and closer to home, warding off small parties of Marred fae who encroached too near to the Unsullied forest. But she did not merely fight to protect her forest home \u2013 she fought still to find Hawthorn. Even if the single cure for Marring was death, Tingalina would have been at peace knowing that Hawthorn was released back into the essence of the world and so could return Unsullied once more. As it were, she had not come across any Marred fae that resembled Hawthorn in any way.\n\nTingalina remembered well the meek faery she had been, how Hawthorn had always been the spirit of freedom and adventure, always pushing her towards new and exciting things. In many ways, it had enabled Tingalina to settle comfortably in her inner world, confident that Hawthorn would always be around to ensure she sufficiently explored the outer world. He was always there to grab her by the hand and force her from one reverie or another to stare in wonder at the barely visible souls in the river, or to listen to the snoring spirits in the trees, or to watch for the longest time as the trees of the forest bore fruit and life bloomed.\n\nAnd then he was not.\n\nAnd that fact had dragged her out of all reveries. She was suddenly ever awake and ever alert. But Tingalina did not think it to be a good alertness or wakefulness, certainly not the type Hawthorn had created. This was the wakefulness brought about by loss and the alertness engendered by pain. Her once soft, dreamy brown eyes were now as bark, her once-soft hands that knew no hardship now those of a warrior who had witnessed more than a dozen encounters, her voice \u2013 that only knew laughter and song \u2013 the cold, commanding one of an Eshgaebar. And her lithe, feminine form was now sculpted and rippled with strength \u2013 which was rather unsettling when mixed with her childish form.\n\nWhen the sound of the conch reached her ears \u2013 three blasts, alerting all who heard that a large enemy host was approaching \u2013 she was swift to call up her brave one-hundred and assemble before Brentylwith the King and Newygnong. Taking to the air, they formed up in the sky above the fog and looked upon the distant clouds of darkness that approached the Unsullied forest. Even from so far away, it looked to be a simply enormous swarm. Brentylwith raised Seihdhos high and gestured for his forces to follow him. Newygnong likewise signalled for her Eshgaebars and their companies to follow her behind the first army, and Tingalina followed her crimson-haired commander.\n\nThe two army groups raced towards the enemy, Brentylwith spearheading directly for the enemy centre while Newygnong maintained her position in reserve. The enemy force grew ever closer, and in the air just north of the Unsullied forest, two great forces of Marred and Unsullied clashed once more.\n\nAs soon as the Marred forces collided with the Unsullied, there came a frantic melee upon the ground and in the air. The Marred had a commander now, a great giant clad in armour of smoke and darkness, who remained in the back with a few Marred as guards, surveying the battle. When the forces had mingled enough, he gave a signal, a haunting wail emanated from his mouth. And the the Marred loosed a terrible magick. From the mouths and hands and chests of the Marred came spherical orbs of darkness, which they launched at the Unsullied. Shocked by the unexpected magicks, Brentylwith's force recoiled from the enemy and found itself fighting desperately to hold the Marred at bay. The strange magick \u2013 unlike anything in existence \u2013 tore through the wickerwork shields and destroyed the wooden spears, and more Unsullied fell in one magick attack than had fallen in entire engagements before. The magick also seemed to have defensive qualities, for the Marred Sullied were far more resistant to blows from the spears of the Unsullied.\n\nThen the Marred commander took to the field with a mace that oozed with the twisted energies of the One Who Mars. The very presence of this commander strengthened nearby Marred and caused terror to grow in the Unsullied. He flung his own magicks at the embattled Unsullied, turning them to dust in a cackling eruption of darkness, and he pummelled anyone foolish enough to come close. They were as nothing before his might and horror. His magicks and mighty mace served to add to the desperation of Brentylwith\u2019s fae.\n\nThis Newygnong saw, and the conch was blown to bring her waiting forces to attention. Raising Purity, she dashed upwards in a great arc, and her troops followed her in an aerial flanking manoeuvre that saw her great force of Unsullied crash into the Marred from above like a tremendous wave. And this time, the red-haired warrioress did not taken on an insectoid form but chose to battle in the form gifted her by her brother, and which so resembled the mighty saffron-haired war goddess. Her hair, like that of her mother, seemed to have a life all its own as she swung Purity with a fury and sent up black dust everywhere.\n\nTingalina and her brave one-hundred, like the other companies, had followed their crimson-haired commander into the fray and hammered into the strengthened enemy with an equal fury, unfazed by this strange new magick that they now had. And when Tingalina saw the enemy commander, who was slowly withdrawing after Newygnong\u2019s great attack, she was set upon by the strongest desire to face him and give him the freedom of death. \u201cOn me!\u201d Came the Eshgaebar's voice through the madness of battle, and her warriors formed up on her as she took to the heavens once again, arcing in the air and crashing down towards the enemy commander and his guard. \u201cUNSULLIED!\u201d Came the terrible warcry which hammered the foe even before the wall of spears and shields.\n\nThe Marred commander looked up, just in time to see Tingalina\u2019s aerial assault land on his position, but he did not move or seem daunted in the slightest, even as his guards turning to black dust all around.\n\nThe commander raised his terrible mace, his gaze fixed on the Eshgaebar as he made for her, and he easily smacked aside several Unsullied warriors who stood in his way. All around Tingalina warriors were brought down by the mere aura of the evil weapon. The commander came before Tingalina, and he looked down at her for the longest time. \u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d his crackling voice came, \u201cit seems we have both changed. As all things must.\u201d He lowered his mace and his voice came again, this time as one Tingalina could recognise. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you\u2026 my dearest Tingalina.\u201d The Eshgaebar felt herself freeze. She looked at the tall figure, shrouded in shadow and armoured in darkness, who shared no resemblance whatsoever with her beloved. Her jaw tightened and her brows furrowed, and her eyes \u2013 hard as bark \u2013 did not soften.\n\n\u201cAnd I have been searching for you, Hawthorn. I searched in the mountains and the streams, across the skies and in the earth, and all over it too. I could not find your presence even amongst the dead. I\u2026 \u201d her lower lip trembled and her grip tightened on her spear and shield, \u201cI missed you so.\u201d Hawthorn cocked his head slightly, noting the poorly-hidden sorrow in his beloved\u2019s voice. It was not Hawthorn\u2019s intent to bring Tingalina pain, for her unmarred existence was already pain enough. Bliss and release from all pain lay in being completely and utterly marred. Hawthorn would change this miserable state she was in. He would make Tingalina whole.\n\n\u201cAnd I missed you, my sweet. When I was taken, my last memories were of you\u2026 how I wished the One Who Mars would have grabbed you too, so that we might have been together all this time. Alas, your search for Hawthorn was destined to end in suffering. For Hawthorn is gone, in his place I am. Onyx. If it should bring you discomfort, know that it is but temporary. Soon you will have bliss, and you will know no suffering.\u201d Onyx reached out for her with a long shrouded hand, \u201cCome with me Tingalina, let me show you what Mar has revealed to me. He can Mar you, unleash your true potential, offer you all you desire\u2026 I will even help you find your true name, my love. Come be with me again. Come, let me hold you once more,\u201d Onyx finished in as kindly a tone as he could manage, and Tingalina could hear and feel his longing.\n\nBut Tingalina\u2019s eyes were full of doubt. She ignored Onyx\u2019s extended hand and, gripping her spear and shield in one hand, floated up to his strange head. Placing a calloused hand upon what passed for his face, she spoke. \u201cHawthorn\u2026 \u201d her hard fingers moving mechanically up and down the side of Onyx\u2019s face \u2013 which seemed to be made of a substance not at all dissimilar to what the Marig were made of \u2013 \u201cHawthorn is not gone. If he is gone, how do you know me? How can you miss me? That is not \u2018Onyx\u2019 speaking, that is Hawthorn. My beautiful Hawthorn, who was my bliss and my shield against all suffering. Come back with me, Hawthorn. Newygnong can fix you \u2013 we will be happy again, you will know who you truly are and be with those who love you for all that you are. Come back with me.\u201d Hope and desperation clung to Tingalina's voice, and perhaps hope was the greater.\n\nOnyx sighed aloud, leaning slightly into Tingalina\u2019s touch, before letting his hands fall. He listened to Tingalina\u2019s whispers. They were invigorating at first, but soon caused his mood to sour. Onyx would not abide to see her holding to such ideas. He needed no fixing, and he was beautiful in his Marred state, not as he once was. He pulled away from Tingalina. \u201cHawthorn is dead.\u201d He stated coldly, \u201cHawthorn was flawed, he was not marred. His memories are my own, but the past is gone.\u201d Onyx\u2019s voice dropped, before becoming softer once more, \u201cI miss you. Onyx misses you, Tingalina. I do not need to be fixed by this Newygnong, for I am at bliss. Now, I ask you again to come with me. Come before Mar, give yourself over. You'll be like me, you will be happy, and marred.\u201d But Tingalina only shook her head and, taking Onyx by the hand pulled at him gently, though she failed to move him.\n\n\u201cYou are not yourself \u2013 I don't know what they've done to you, but you need to know that this isn't you. We were happy before \u2013 you were happy, don't you remember? Don't you remember when Selsibella caught that huge fish and she was scaring everybody with it and then you-\u201d and here Tingalina suddenly smiled, \u201cand you took it from her and thwacked her all the way back to the river! And that other time when you were so excited over the apples blooming, and insisted we sit and watch them from the end of winter until they were in full bloom \u2013 you got so bored waiting around, but in the end stayed just for me. And when we stayed up all night at midwinter\u2019s just to watch the stars \u2013 and you put your head on my shoulder and it was so\u2026 it was so right. And when the fireflies came out for the first time! Don't you remember how happy we were?\u201d\n\nTingalina\u2019s smile caused Onyx to grip her hand tighter. Emotions swelled within him at Tingalina\u2019s soft, excited voice, and at the memories she spoke of so fondly. He remembered Selsibella and the fish, the apples blooming in spring, the stars at midwinter\u2019s, the fireflies of summer \u2013 all of them. But whatever love and beauty there might have been then was marred by the flawed life he now saw in them all. He looked to Tingalina, a small bit of light, not unlike a tear, rolling down his chest before fizzling and evaporating into mist. Onyx now saw Tingalina anew, for she was not the Tingalina he remembered. She was hardened, calloused, a warrior \u2013 not the soft fae Hawthorn had stolen glances at when she was off in her own head somewhere. They had changed her, the King, this Newygnong. They had taken the Tingalina who would have listened to him and buried her beneath callouses and muscle, hidden her behind spear and shield.\n\nOnyx pulled away from Tingalina, his voice betraying emotion, \u201cI remember all. How could I not? But I do not care for those memories. What I care for is you, Tingalina. You. How can you not see that? They've changed you. The King, this Newygnong! Your tender heart is gone, replaced by one of stone!\u201d Onyx bemoaned. \u201cI should have known they would feed you lies. I should have come for you sooner, before they twisted you away from me. Then you would have listened.\u201d Onyx\u2019s voice dropped to but a broken whisper now, \u201cI love you still. I thought you would love me too\u2026 more so like this.\u201d Tingalina jerked at the unexpected words \u2013 not that it was anything she did not know \u2013 but it very suddenly warmed her. Onyx continued without pause, \u201cI\u2019m better now, superior to what I once was. I wish you would have seen that. Now\u2026 now I must to force you. You will thank me once you are Marred.\u201d Onyx then snapped to attention and took hold of Tingalina by her forearm, and he pulled her with him as he began to ascend and fly from the battle, which would soon be an undeniable victory for the Marred. Tingalina was too stunned to immediately react to the stronger fae\u2019s grasp (could he be called a fae, truly?), but when she had regained her composure she...", "action_results": [{"action": "immediately began resisting.", "result": "\u201cHawthorn! St- stop! Let m- let me go! Stop it!\u201d But there was little she could do against the might of Mar's chosen, and she felt herself pulled slowly, but surely, from the field of battle. It shook Onyx to hear her cries, but he was adamant on showing her the truth he had seen, no matter how much it pained her now. \u201cSel! Miri! Help me!\u201d The Eshgaebar cried, but the two could be seen down below fighting desperately with the others in what was clearly a losing battle, and Newygnong\u2019s crimson hair could be seen in the distance as she single-handedly fought off the enemies swarming her, and it was almost certain that she could not see or hear Tingalina\u2019s plight. \u201cHawthorn, please \u2013 don't do th-\u201d but her words were suddenly overwhelmed by a new sound \u2013 it was like the drone of ten-thousand bizzlebazzles, and even those fighting paused momentarily to look about them, fearing some enemy ambush.\n\nThere, in the distance but approaching at terrifying speed, was a great swarm that blotted out the edge of the world. They came in their thousands, in a surprisingly orderly manner and wielding wooden spears and holding their own shields of animal hide. They came wailing their warcries and screeching their fury \u2013 for they too had been wronged by the vile Marig, and had been set upon by their Marred brethren. The great Sullied horde crashed into the Marred swarm with a thunderous clap that shook the heavens \u2013 for like the earth, even the heaven could be made to shake! \u2013 and they set upon their Marred foes. \u201cDUST! DUST! MAKE THEM DUST!\u201d was their wrathful cry.\n\nConfusion swept the ranks of the Marred fae, even Onyx, distracted by the sudden approach of the Sullied horde, forgot to hold Tingalina tight. This momentary slackening offered Tingalina the opportunity to escape from her maddened once-lover, and back into the thick of battle. Onyx let out a haunting, dismal cry, \u201cNo! Come back! Don't go\u2026\u201d but before he could give chase, he took hold of himself and realised that the threat of the Sullied would overwhelm his Marred forces. Begrudgingly, he signalled for a retreat. He shed silent tears at the thought of Tingalina, for Onyx had not \u2013 could not \u2013 believe the outcome of their fated meeting. He did not understand what had come over him. The sight of Tingalina alone had softened his Marred heart, her voice had rid him of his ability to think or reason, and even in the midst of battle he had not cared for fighting or for victory. All due to her. As the Marred retreated en masse, he knew that Mar would not be best pleased about this. Next time, if there was one, Onyx would have no choice but to fight to the end. How bitter was that knowledge!", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "With the Marred retreating before the mad strike of the Sullied swarm, the significantly reduced Unsullied armies permitted themselves a sigh of relief before quickly forming up and retreating to the safety of their forest home. The Sullied continued to fight, groups of them breaking off and giving chase to the retreating Marred, screaming obscenities and pledging bloody vengeance. Eventually, however, the Mistress of the Sullied Court at the Heights of Utter Villainy reined her subjects in and sent a messenger to the Unsullied, inviting them out to parley.\n\n\u201cParley?! With dirty Sullied?\u201d some exclaimed with great revulsion, but Brentylwith the King flew with a small guard of honour and met the Mistress. A tall, female Sullied of green complexion, four-armed and legless (for legs she had a single appendage that somewhat resembled a tail), she was everything that an Unsullied was not. With large eyes of complete gold and a mouth in each of her two cheeks, her face was in itself an unnerving sight.\n\n\u201cHail, Brentylwith the King,\u201d she spoke, \u201cI am Fiula, daughter of Asula the Matriarch, Mistress of the the Sullied Court at the Heights of Utter Villainy. My greeting is peace, my offer assistance, my foe is your foe and I would avail myself of your strength as you would be well-advised to avail yourself of mine.\u201d It was clear that she had no interest in frivolous talk and had no desire for these discussions to take longer than the absolute minimum necessary \u2013 mutual foe or not, the Sullied and Unsullied were by no means natural or easy allies.\n\n\u201cYou have my thanks, Mistress Fiula, I believe that my standing here is owed to you,\u201d spoke the considerably battle-worn King. \u201cYour assistance is appreciated, and I would be a most foolish King if I refused the assistance of one who has already offered it freely. Though I do not deny the mutual hostility of our two races, yet this Marred foe is a danger to us and more than us \u2013 to nature on which we all depend. I would ally with you and fight by your side, Fiula of the Sullied.\u201d And it was a thing agreed.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "For her part, Tingalina had disappeared deep into the forest the moment she had disentangled herself from the battle, searching for a place of darkness and warmth to bury herself a while and forget her very existence. And she found just such a place in a cave whose entrance was nearly entirely concealed by greenery, and the inside of which was a humid mess. She lay on the ground, burying her face into the warm cave wall and bringing her arms about her head and her knees to her chest. And she remained in that way for a long time, replaying the events of the battle and the words that Hawthorn \u2013 Onyx? \u2013 had spoken.\n\nEven now it was surreal \u2013 the idea that Hawthorn could have spoken those words was both cause for joy and misery. It was so clear he was in there, so clear that despite everything they had done to change him they could not change his quintessence. And yet he was not entirely Hawthorn \u2013 this Onyx was eating at him, burying him, suffocating him. Tingalina turned her head from the wall and looked in the darkness towards the cave ceiling, and though her eyes were teary there was a sudden hardness there.\n\nFor next time, if Newygnong was not close by to truly fix him, she would stop at nothing to set her Hawthorn free.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "It was not too long after Mar left his lair, grinning wickedly as he was wont to do, that a certain saffron-haired goddess \u2013 following a trail only she seemed to perceive \u2013 came upon the entrance. Looking left and right, agitated by the clear presence of evil in this place, she called out: \u201cDwyni! You here?\u201d The goddess stepped into the strange cave, her hair a source of immediate light in the sudden darkness. \u201cDwyni!\u201d she called again, stepping deeper and deeper within. The little pixie\u2019s trail led, without a doubt, into this place. How she could have ended up here, the goddess could only guess.\n\nEventually she came to a strange pit frothing with a clearly vile and toxic substance, and she turned her nose up in disgust. \u201cBy all things, Dwyni, how did you even find this place?\u201d She sensed a movement above her and immediately looked up. There, hidden in a crack in the cave ceiling, was the undeniable winged form of a tiny faery, staring out at the goddess in what could only be shock.\n\n'DWYNI!' The goddess cried out in pleasure, reaching out to the little thing. Releasing a happy squeal, the small pixie zipped down and fluttered about the goddess\u2019 face, stroking her ears and pulling at her hair playfully, before eventually settling down on the flame-haired goddess\u2019 nose. The goddess gently stroked the little one\u2019s head and cooed slightly. With her beloved companion found, she turned around and began making her way out. She had not taken more than a few steps from the toxic pit, however, before a shrouded figure \u2013 rivalling even her in size \u2013 appeared. The goddess frowned and took on a guarded stance.\n\n\u201cMario.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck! How many times do I have to tell you not to call me that!?\u201d The One Who Mars snapped. He scrutinised the other divine with distaste. She looked much the same as he remembered, naked as usual, with her long flowing locks of red hair that illuminated his work-in-progress den. His frown deepened.\n\n\u201cI now know where your son found his impeccable sense of curiosity, sister.\u201d Mar started in a tone devoid of any emotion. \u201cBut unlike Brahun Dan, who snuck his way inside, you walk in quite brazenly. I admire that. So, to what do I owe this unwelcome visit from our resident war goddess and incorrigible streaker? Have you come to destroy me at last? Tell me how wicked I am for taking your pets? You can blame every idiot prancing around on my lawn for that!\u201d Mar finished with anger. It had all started with her anyway. All this was her fault. The goddess only frowned in confusion.\n\n\u201cYou mean\u2026 you brought Dwyni here? Why would you do that \u2013 you know Dwyni is mine.\u201d The pixie settled atop the head of the Flame-haired goddess and looked at Mar with an expression of clear irreverence. \u201cI don't much care who you\u2019re taking and doing whatever it is you do to things, but Dwyni is mine and you had no right to take her from me.\u201d With a hostile look, she made to move past Mar and leave this horrid place.\n\nMar was slightly confused, he did not know what a Dwyni was, but somehow the Flame-haired goddess believed him to have taken it. He supposed it really didn't matter in the end and moved in front of her with a quick speed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? I\u2019ve been itching to punish someone for all these damn shenanigans that keep taking place. For the numerous sins enacted against me by the others, and for those of your stupid blacksmith son, who have all escaped my punishment, I cannot let you go. Forgive me, sister, I did not wish it to be you who I experimented on first \u2013 and I didn\u2019t not wish it be you either, just to make that clear \u2013 but know that you will soon be just as marred as me, and all will be forgiven.\u201d Mar then grabbed the goddess and started draggin her to the pit.\n\nThough this was a clear act of aggression, the goddess did not feel immediately threatened at all \u2013 who could hope to truly pose a threat to her, after all? She only raised an eyebrow as the surprisingly strong Mar dragged her further into the cave. \u201cWhat, you still think that you can put me out, that I'll descend into a heap of ash? Give up on your delusions, Mario, this isn't a flame you can just put out.\u201d And with that, she brought the arm he was grabbing up against his chest and pushed him back with a short strong shove, sending him falling back onto the stone ground. \u201cAnd don't you know it\u2019s bad manners to force yourself on a lady? You need to work on your dubious flirting technique.\u201d She laughed.\n\nGrimacing, Mar stood back up to his full height, a low hiss emanating from his throat. \u201cPut you out? No dear, I only wish to brighten your flames further. I will show you true enlightenment, and this petty fight will be but the start of a beautiful future for you and for all the others. Come now, don't be like this, I only want to better you.\u201d Mar purred in a silky voice. \u201cAnd maybe then you'll stop calling me that disgusting name,\u201d he added with a scowl, before smoothing it over and extending a hand to her, \u201cbut yes, where are my manners? You\u2019ll have to forgive me again. I will only ask once; will you join me? Become something greater, something Marred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess you do have manners after all. But no, Mario, I'm pretty happy as I am \u2013 we're your siblings, not your playdough, take us as we are.\u201d A golden mist became clearer and more defined around her, and it coagulated into the form of a silver shortsword with a pommel in the shape of a roaring bear\u2019s head. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to leave. Forget your delusions of \u2018punishing\u2019 me. If you try to stop me, I'll be doing more than pushing you back.\u201d And with a final look, half warning and half wary, she turned and made for the cave\u2019s entrance at a swift trot.\n\nMar dropped his extended hand and shook his head. The sword was a threat of course, especially in her hands, but there were ways to subdue even her. A concentration of marring energies and dark magicks grew about his hand and he leapt after the goddess and reached to grab her again. On his touch, the goddess turned on him with a sudden fury, her face morphing very suddenly into a monstrous visage and her form growing threefold, red fur exploding everywhere.\n\n'BACK OFF!' Came her dreadful, sonorous growl, and with a vicious, powerful, and swift movement that was over before Mar had completely registered it, she skewered him through the chest with bear-pommelled Ursus Mater. The force of the strike alone caused the ground beneath Mar to explode into dust, and the god was forced from her sight, Ursus Mater still impaling him, as the singular assault sent him flying into the depths of the cave. The sudden display of divine force shook the mountains, and outside the horrific sound of the world breaking pierced the heavens, and the earth shook, and Mount Blight trembled.\n\nWith that, the saffron-haired goddess turned and \u2013 in a few lithe strides \u2013 exploded from the cave in a flurry of red hair. Twisting up into the air, the feminine form of the goddess was revealed unblemished and fair. Except for her right arm, which was black and blue and writhing and sickly, its surface bubbling like a mudpot. She stared at her arm in disgust and saw that the Marring was growing aggressively. Her ascent into the heavens faltered and she found herself circling about the pinnacle of Mount Blight before she landed on it with a groan. Her entire arm was now consumed, and the Marring was growing up her shoulder and sending snaking tendrils up her neck and right breast.\n\nCoughing, and finding that ichor and shadow emerged, she released a great wail that echoed across the world, that echoed even into the soundless spaces beyond the stratosphere, echoed even where the One Who Burns sat in silent vigil among the stars. And the hair of the saffron-haired goddess went up in flames, and Dwynen cried out in fear and grief as the goddess forcefully burned \u2013 for it was better far to burn out with the cry of freedom than to buckle and fade away a slave. And her skin flayed and ichor sprang up into the heavens and was carried on clouds to far and distant lands and places, and it mixed with souls and with the spirits of the earth, and everywhere the ichor of the goddess landed there grew a Blood-headed warrior to fight; her crowning gift to the world. And her very face hardened and became a warmask of fire-burned wood.\n\nAnd the body of the goddess burned, and her ichor became a rain of blood, and her brilliant fiery hair\u2026\n\n\nOn the peak of the Marred Mount there burns\n\nA ceaseless blaze;\n\nA smokeless fire whose fuel is god\n\nThe Flame Eternal", "action_results": [{"action": "And war will be made to perish", "result": "And in the skies, not far from where the death of a goddess would soon be declared, the warring faery hordes gathered once more. With seven Marig at his side, and his eyes set unswervingly on victory, Onyx hovered at the head of his horde of Marred fae. Swarming before him were the united forces of the Sullied and Unsullied, conches blaring and commands sounding. They were confident, for they had achieved victory twice before and were almost certain that now, with their great numbers and training and discipline and weaponry, they would be undefeated once more. A certain elation filled the hearts of the Sullied and Unsullied, and they did not think much of death but thought only of the vengeance they would wreak on these Marred fae and their Marig allies.\n\nWith three-thousand at his back, and four-thousand standing ready behind Newygnong, and the great horde of Sullied that numbered over ten-thousand, the forces resisting the Marred stood ready. Then a conch sounded suddenly and, raising Purity high, the crimson-haired Newygnong ordered her troops forward. Unafraid to do her mother\u2019s bidding, she led from the front, roaring warcries as she dashed forth. And even as she did, in the distance the earth could be heard to shake and the mountains seen to tremble.\n\nHawthorn gripped his mace tighter when he saw that crimson-haired demon, Newygnong, in the distance. He released a hair-raising warcry, and the Marred swarm charged at the Unsullied and Sullied, from up above and down below. Onyx could feel it in his bones. This would be the final battle, one way or another. The Marred commander charged in with his minions, releasing powerful magick blasts that sundered his foes to dust.\n\nEven as he swung and crushed and meted out death, Onyx kept a close look out for Tingalina. For he would find her this time, and he would take her. If this was the final battle, then Onyx would have his victory and his love would come to his side, for better or for worse. The only way to find Tingalina without searching was to face the Demon in battle, this Newygnong. Onyx had determined to break her, and she was easy enough to spot harvesting countless Marred and releasing them in a great screaming pillar of dust and ash. Onyx charged towards Newygnong, killing fae left and right on his single-minded path.\n\nThe crimson-haired warrioress immediately saw the great Marred fae, shrouded in shadow and armoured in darkness. Hefting Purity, she dashed towards him with a great cry, and sword met mace. This time, unlike when Newygnong clashed with Brentylwith, the warrioress had a better grasp of her sword\u2019s power and no great obliterating blast ensued, but the blow caught Onyx off-guard for he had not expected her to be so strong. Circling lithely around the enemy commander, she struck and Purity licked at her foe\u2019s neck. Onyx barely managed to dodge, forcefully throwing himself back and half flying, half falling downwards to avoid the blow.\n\nEven so, the tip grazed his face, and agony ripped through his body. It burned with a power unknown to him, and it caused a sudden terror to swell up within him. He would have to be careful with this opponent. He clutched at the mace with his hand, willing its auras and dark magicks to emanate like dark flames all about him, then stepped forth and swung fury once more, seeking to break the Demon\u2019s chest in.\n\nFearlessly, Newygnong leapt forth to meet his strike, the ultimate weapon of Marring facing off against the great weapon Purity, the great corrupter of all things facing the absolute purifier. But in the split second before their weapons clashed once more, a horrific sound of thunder seemed to split the world, leaving everyone frozen and aghast. It was momentary, five seconds, ten seconds perhaps, and everyone swiftly returned to the fray. Everyone, that is, bar Newygnong, whose beautiful crimson hair had suddenly become as white as snow. She drifted in the air before Onyx, shock plastered on her face, her suddenly weak grip loosening and tightening around Purity\u2019s hilt.\n\nOnyx looked around for the source of the sound, but found nothing and quickly turned back to his opponent to find the Demon\u2019s hair shrivelling and whitening, her face stricken with shock. He cared little for what had caused it, but it was clearly a moment of weakness. Onyx stepped forth with a shrill, triumphant squawk, and raising his terrible mace high into the air, brought it thundering down on Newygnong's chest. There was a sickening crunch of carapace breaking, a small shock wave ripping through the air, and then the warrioress began to fall. Onyx stared with a maniacal grin, relishing the moment of his victory. Now Tingalina would be his, and she would truly see his greatness, his love, the correctness of his enlightened path.\n\nAnd a trail of blood followed in the falling Newygnong\u2019s wake, her eyes glazed over and her hair whipping about her as her body tumbled head over heels, twisting and turning in its earthbound trajectory. Purity was released from her grasp and for a few moments fell by her side, as if in mourning. And then the distance between them grew and the sword stopped its descent altogether, and began to rise. In the chaos of the aerial battlefield, the golden-haired Tingalina watched in dumb shock the fall of Newygnong.\n\nBut it could not be Newygnong. For the one who fell had white hair.\n\nAnd Purity rose with sudden speed, shrinking and morphing to fit the grasp of the one who would wield it now. And the voice of the Livingsword sounded, and it was -\n\n\n\u201cGo Forth, Tingalina.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd she dashed across the aerial battlefield towards Onyx, loosing a shriek of demented fury.

A bizzlebazzle settled on it and buried its mandibles in. The goddess laughed and stroked the little thing\u2019s delicate wings. But it quickly became apparent that something was amiss, for the bizzlebazzle quickly blackened and turned on the goddess, biting her finger. Squealing in surprise, the saffron-haired goddess released the red fruit and pulled her hand away from the insect.

In the distance: war.\n\nGiving the tree a final glance, the goddess drew deeper into Mar\u2019s territories and soon came upon a small host of Unsullied, with little makeshift spears in their hands, struggling with one of Mar's monstrosities. \u201cTingalina! From the side!\u201d One was shouting.\n\n\u201cIts eye! Get its eye!\u201d But even with their weapons, they were clearly outmatched and soon the hundred or so Unsullied made to escape.

The Marig croaked something unintelligible and shrunk back, and the goddess let it go and watched it flee.\n\nCheering, the Unsullied host surrounded the goddess and, all of them carrying her, took her back to Elabeen and Fylmira. The Lord and Lady immediately recognised the goddess and told her of their plight, and how even with the aid of mighty Brentylwith they suffered at the hands of the Marig.\n\n\u201cAnd where is Brentylwith?\u201d The goddess asked.\n\n\u201cI am here, Flame-haired goddess.\u201d The King announced as he made his entrance, followed by some ten Unsullied. Behind them all was a pale woman with stunning red hair! Who it could possibly be \u2013 an admirer of hers, perhaps? She was certainly no fae, far too big. The Unsullied King was about to speak again, but before he could the shout of the stranger over-rode him completely.\n\n\u201cMother!\u201d cried the pale, red-haired humanoid. The goddess looked at her more closely and frowned, for this carapaced warrior-woman had hair as red and thick as her own, and yet she did not remember creating or mothering her. \u201cMother, it\u2019s me,\u201d the pale woman stepped towards the saffron-haired goddess.\n\n\u201cI am mother to many things. Are you a fae of some kind? Where are your wings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I am no faery. It's me, Newygnong. I have become beautiful \u2013 like you.\u201d The pale one smiled and the goddess\u2019 eyes widened. She approached the woman, stroking her face admiringly.\n\n\u201cWow, Newy! You've really changed. How in the world did you go from giant millipede to this?\u201d Newygnong beamed at the goddess\u2019 clear approval for her new form.\n\n\u201cDo you love me now? Will you be my mother?\u201d The goddess cocked her head in confusion.\n\n\u201cWhat in the world do you mean, Newy? I've always loved you \u2013 but your mammeh (and pappeh) is that piggish eater, not me.\u201d Newygnong's face fell and she frowned.\n\n\u201cB- but\u2026 I \u2026 \u201d she paused, \u201cwhy can't you be my mother?

Brentylwith raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cBut goddess! Did you not say just before this that she is not yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cNewygnong was given to me by her creator, Piggo.

If things were not so dire here I would be there to save my subjects! Flame-haired goddess, know that Newygnong, who wields the Livingsword, has joined the Unsullied cause against the one who wishes to Mar us here. And when we have dealt with him, we must face the One Who Eats as well. Will you not aid us?\u201d\n\n\u201cLivingsword?\u201d The goddess asked, completely ignoring the King and looking at Newygnong. Newygnong drew her sword and handed it to the goddess for inspection. The goddess immediately knew it to be of her son\u2019s making \u2013 such was the motherly instinct \u2013 and wondered what Brahun Dan had been up to since she birthed him in the ocean and watched him rush off into the world. \u201cThis is of Danny\u2019s making.\u201d The goddess said, looking to Newygnong.\n\n\u201cYes, goddess, Brahan Dan made it and named it Purity. He gifted me with it \u2013 it is a living, speaking sword. But I have yet to hear it speak. It was he who rid me of my previous ugliness and aided me to become beautiful.\u201d Brentylwith approached Newygnong and inspected her. Her pale face looked like it had been chiselled of snow, her black lips small yet full, and seemingly ever pursed in a disapproving straight line.\n\n\u201cYou were ugly?\u201d Brentylwith asked, hovering so that he was face-level with her as he continued inspecting her features.\n\n\u201cYes. Until very recently, I was a giant bug.\u201d Brentylwith grimaced and backed away somewhat.\n\n\u201cAh, I see. Well. You have a done a rather good job on yourself. Why, you are as pretty as any one of the Unsullied Queens.\u201d Newygnong blinked at the compliment. Before she could respond, the saffron-haired goddess intervened.\n\n\u201cHere, have your sword back. He\u2019s a bit of a killjoy.\u201d The goddess says as she hands the sword to Newygnong. Newygnong blinks at her words. \u201cHow is Danny anyway? He popped out, I brought him to my teat, and then he was suddenly all grown-up. Made me a sword minutes after his birth, the little bugger. They grow so fast these days.\u201d Newygnong makes to respond, but the King cuts across her.\n\n\u201cGreat goddess! With utmost respect, but the fate of this Unsullied Court hangs in the balance.\u201d The goddess nods.\n\n\u201cOh yes, Mario and his minions. And Piggo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fight the Marig \u2013 hideous beings that kidnap our people and take them into the heart of the mountain.\u201d He informed her. \u201cAnd of late we have witness strange fae-like creatures that seem to be made of shadow and darkness. I fear they are what has become of those who have been abducted.\u201d\n\nBut the goddess, though she pitied the faeries their plight, had to find her Dwynen, and she told the King as much. \u201cDwynen? The pixie who was present on the island of our creation? Was she not rescued then?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was,\u201d the goddess sighed, \u201cbut then I became heavy with child and couldn\u2019t protect her, and she was taken off by a Sullied fae.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gave birth to this Brahan Dan after creating us?\u201d The goddess noded.\n\n\u201cThe sword did it.\u201d The King blinked. \u201cYour sword.\u201d His eyes widened and he spluttered.\n\n\u201cMy what? Me? No! Hold on. I did no su-\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Warsword, Brenny.\u201d The King pauses his jaw slackening as understanding dawns. He shakes himself out of it and frowns, getting back to the matter at hand.\n\n\u201cFlame-haired goddess, will you aid us if we provide you with help in finding your missing pixie?\u201d The King asked. The goddess did not think she needed help, but after considering his offer for a few short moments, with her mind on the siren tree she had seen and what Brentylwith was saying, she agreed offhandedly.\n\nOver the next few days, she set about teaching the Unsullied how to properly make war. \u201cTo defend yourselves successfully, you must understand the ways and laws of war,\u201d the goddess declared, \u201cBrentylwith has taught you to hunt your foes with weapons, but that is not enough \u2013 one must know how to use that weapon, war requires warriors. But the skills of a warrior are not enough, for warriors must organise themselves well to succeed and attain victory in the fray.\u201d And the goddess approached Brentylwith and Elabeen and Fylmira and taught them these things, and she taught them to many others too.\n\nThen, some days later, she left with Brentylwith and Newygnong and some fifteen Unsullied to continued the search for her stolen Dwynen.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "\u201cI knew that damn red slut was involved in this! Her scent was all over those bloody fae.\u201d Mar cried out when he discovered the saffron-haired goddess\u2019 part in all this. \u201cThose damn Unsullied have a stubborn will to survive and thrive and be that\u2019s just as blindly bull-headed as their mother\u2019s. Damn you, you red bitch! It\u2019s like you made them to annoy me again!\u201d He sat on a rock, for he had not gotten around to making a throne and all the other fancy-schmancy things a dark god should really have in his lair, and he remembered the saffron-haired goddess\u2019 promise to him so long ago.\n\n\u201cI will not flee. I am the enduring fire that will sear your marrings from every heart and plain, the sheltering flame against your unwanted perversions. Be afraid, boyo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that scarlet minx.\u201d He grumbled.\n\nYet it had not been the saffron-haired goddess\u2019 intention, when she created the Sullied and the Unsullied, that they fight Mar at all. That over-inflated tosser was the last thing on her mind then; but it seemed the very nature of her fae had brought them into conflict with the killjoy of the pantheon.\n\nNow when the goddess descended and saw the plight of her creations, she had not sought to declare herself their saviour and messiah, at most she would have gifted them with the skill to fight off their oppressor before rushing off. She had to find her \u201cDwyni\u201d after all. Yet Brentylwith\u2019s pleas had found a way into her heart, and what she had seen of the strange siren tree and of the fae\u2019s staunch resistance inclined her towards aiding those who, against all odds, faced-off against a god.\n\nAs far as the saffron-haired goddess was concerned, the clash of different forces one against the other was only normal and to be expected. From such clashes emerged great heroes and brave deeds, from such clashes mortals and immortals alike came to know what ought to be valued and cherished, what deserved to be fought for, and what ought to be shunned and repudiated and repelled. The Sullied and Unsullied would fight Mar's forces, and if victorious, they would emerge harrowed, but bettered and refined, and they would be made glorious in her eyes. And she did not consider herself above such clashes either, she embraced the opportunity to leap in and place her mark.\n\nMost importantly, victory would bring them freedom. The forces that would restrict the essential freedom of all things could win battles, could even establish an ephemeral order that would seemingly last eternally; but nothing could for too long hold at bay the will for freedom.

Tingalina, who was among those chosen to join the company, had scoured these skies and searched these hilly and mountainous landscapes much since Hawthorn was stolen. She had hoped that maybe he had been abandoned somewhere by his kidnappers and her diligent searching would eventually uncover him, but she had not had any such luck and her hope had slowly begun to crumble.\n\n\u201cSo how have you tracked down your Dwynen to these mountains, Flame-haired goddess? It seems a far distance from the island of our birth,\u201d the Unsullied King questioned, and Tingalina found herself looking with sudden interest to the goddess, who glanced at the King and tapped the side of her nose.\n\n\u201cI followed her scent, and the trail led me here. Got side-tracked of course, by you lot mainly, but my nose never fails. It\u2019ll get me to my Dwyni.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan your nose track anyone other than Dwyni?\u201d Tingalina asked, her eyes wide and shining.\n\n\u201cMy nose can track just about anything \u2013 but I need the scent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scent? How do you get that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo maybe a hair, blood, an item of some kind that the thing I\u2019m tracking possessed.\u201d She paused, \u201ca body part works too.\u201d Tingalina frowned.\n\n\u201cWhat about a place someone has been?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they have been there quite recently, then certainly. That\u2019s even better because it provides the scent and there is likely a trail nearby.\u201d Tingalina bit her lips and flew nearer to the goddess.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 there\u2019s someone I need to find too.\u201d The goddess nodded offhandedly.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s find her too then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHim,\u201d Tingalina smiled faintly. The goddess\u2019 lips parted into a broad, hearty smile, flashing teeth, that seemed on the verge of exploding into a laugh but did not quite do so, and an impish flame seemed to dance about in her green eyes as she gave the fae a playfully teasing look.\n\n\u201cBetter too wild than two tame. Tame's lame,\u201d she chuckled, and Tingalina laughed along though she did not get the joke or understand what the goddess meant.\n\nNow, our flying band of misfits \u2013 resolute in purpose, of robust principles, of single-minded vision, intent on finding Dwyni or perishing in th\u2019endeavour! \u2013 dashed dashingly (in so dashing a dashingly dashing manner as to dash all prior understandings of dashingness into oblivion) across the great open expanses o\u2019 the cosmic empyrean plain of the infinitly spreading firmaments, up, up, and away. Or maybe that\u2019s not quite what and how it happened. But in any case!\n\nSoon the nose of the goddess led the brave band to the entrance of a cave high on Mount Blight. Newygnong frowned and looked to the goddess, and told her that this place reeked of Marring. The others looked around near the entrance, agitated by the clear presence of evil in this place, and the goddess stepped ahead of them and called out: \u201cDwyni! You here?\u201d There was no response, and the goddess stepped into the strange cave, her hair a source of immediate light in the sudden darkness, something her companions were grateful for. \u201cDwyni!\u201d She called again, stepping deeper and deeper within.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think we might attract something if we shout like that?\u201d Brentylwith asked the goddess, who shrugged. It wasn\u2019t like there was anything in the world that could threaten her, not even other gods.\n\n\u201cHow in the world did the pixie end up here?\u201d Asked one of the fae, Selsibella.\n\n\u201cMaybe she was kidnapped, like our fae.\u201d Tingalina suggested.\n\nEventually they came to a strange pit frothing with a clearly vile and toxic substance, and even the goddess turned her nose up in disgust. \u201cBy all things, Dwyni, how did you even find this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something up here!\u201d Newygnong declared, and the goddess looked above her. Her eyes immediately saw, hidden in a crack in the cave ceiling, the undeniable winged form of a tiny pixie staring out at the goddess in what could only be shock.\n\n\u201cDWYNI!\u201d The goddess cried out, reaching out to the little thing. Releasing a happy squeal, the small pixie zipped down and fluttered about the goddess\u2019 face, stroking her ears and pulling at her hair playfully, before eventually settling down on the flame-haired goddess\u2019 nose. The goddess gently stroked the little one\u2019s head and cooed slightly. \u201cWhose my pretty little adorable- mwah.\u201d A few of the others stared, cringing at the display of inordinate affection. But seeing as the goddess had prioritised finding her Dwyni over the war against Mar, there was no doubting that the histrionics were genuine.\n\nHer beloved companion found, she turned to the others and began leading them out of the lair. She had not taken more than a few steps from the toxic pit, however, before a shrouded figure \u2013 rivalling even the goddess in size \u2013 appeared. The goddess frowned and took on a guarded stance, and Tingalina gasped.\n\n\u201cMario.\u201d \n\n\u201cMar!\u201d Came Tingalina\u2019s voice simultaneously.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d The One Who Mars yelled at the goddess, surprising her companions and causing Newygnong to fully draw her already half-drawn sword. The One Who Mars scrutinised the sword and stepped back slightly, his frown deepening. That sword could certainly hurt him. He looked at the other divine and her band of minions with distaste. She looked much the same as he remembered, naked as usual, with her long flowing locks of red hair, that illuminated his work-in-progress lair, wrapped around her like a great coat.\n\n\u201cI now know where your son found his impeccable sense of curiosity, sister.\u201d Mar started in a tone devoid of any emotion. \u201cBut unlike Brahun Dan, who snuck his way inside, you and your merry band of pinheads walk in quite brazenly. I admire that. So, to what do I owe this unwelcome visit from our resident war goddess and chronic streaker? Have you come to destroy me with your little band? Tell me how wicked I am for taking your pets? You can blame these damn idiots prancing around on my lawn for that!\u201d Mar finished with anger as he gestured towards Brentylwith and his fae. \u201cIdiots of your making, may I add. You started it, and I\u2019m going to finish it.\u201d The goddess only frowned in confusion.\n\n\u201cSo Tingalina was right! You brought Dwyni here. Why would you do that \u2013 you know Dwyni is mine.\u201d The pixie settled atop the head of the Flame-haired goddess and looked at Mar with an expression of clear irreverence. \u201cNow it\u2019s fair enough if you\u2019re kidnapping fae \u2013 I don\u2019t approve, but fair enough. But Dwyni is mine and you had no right to take her from me.\u201d With a hostile look, she stepped forward and pointed at the other god. \u201cNow we\u2019re leaving, so you better step aside boyo. I came to get Dwyni, but if you push me then I\u2019ve no problem with absolutely trashing the gig you\u2019ve got here.\u201d\n\nMar was slightly confused, he did not know what a Dwyni was, but somehow the Flame-haired goddess believed him to have taken it. He supposed it really didn't matter in the end, and he definitely didn\u2019t appreciate the unveiled, butt-naked in the middle of his lair threat. But he looked again to the sword in Newygnong\u2019s hand, and saw Brentylwith\u2019s hand on the pommel of what was clearly another sword he didn\u2019t want to be going up against. \u201cFirst your son comes waltzing in here, now you come along with every damn pinhead you could bring with you. This is an affront. This is my lair, you don\u2019t get to come and go as you please! You fully deserve punishment.\u201d\n\nThe golden aura around the goddess condensed and coagulated into the form of a silver shortsword with a pommel in the shape of a roaring bear\u2019s head, and she grasped it. Looking coldly at Mar, she pointed the blade at him. \u201cNot you, or anyone else, can punish me boyo.\u201d Mar scowled, and the frustrating thing was that it was true. But if he could not punish her\u2026\n\nA concentration of marring energies and dark magicks grew about his hand, and with a hellish screech of, \u201cI\u2019m marring you tonight, bitch!\u201d he flung it right her companions. The goddess, eyes glimmering, leapt before the blast and swung her sword with a head-splitting battle-cry. The orb was cleft in twain and winked from existence. A small after-blast washed over the goddess, but it could do her no harm.\n\n\u201cIf you try that again, I\u2019m going to skewer you boyo.\u201d Mar only grinned.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t have to, dearest sister,\u201d he purred while backing away. The goddess frowned. \u201cIt brings me great pleasure to mar your day, sister, but for fear of having my own day marred I shall bid you now adieu. Until next time,\u201d and with that, he blurred, became a black haze, and was gone.\n\nThe saffron-haired goddess stared at where he had been, then turned to her companions in confusion. They all seemed alright, the dark magicks had not even gotten near them. Brentylwith and Tingalina, and Newygnong of course, and all of the fae.\n\nThen the goddess paused. She completely stopped. Her hand trembled and the confusion on her face fell. Her visage was as stone. She raised a hand to her head, and it came away with a multi-coloured fluid that she knew was blood. She looked at her wetted fingers blankly, and her companions stared at her, horror slowly building on their faces. The goddess lowered her hand and gazed at the others with glazed eyes.\n\n\u201cDwyn.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Rage", "result": "The saffron-haired goddess raised a shaking bloodied hand to her face, and tears fell from her wide, glaring eyes. There was a slight growl, though it might have been the wind.\n\n\nSomeone had sung a song, just for her, and it had been beautiful. And it had brought laughter to the Bear Mother\u2019s face, loud and warm and contagious. And a little pixie fluttering about her head had stared at her wide-eyed and giggled too, then landed on the Bear Mother\u2019s nose and hugged it. She had left it for a few moments, and then picked the little pixie off her nose and stroked her in the palm of her hand.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d the goddess said, \u201cthat Kippers makes some very pretty things, doesn't she?\u201d The pixie had batted her finger away coyishly as if to say oh you! The goddess only laughed and placed the pixie on her head, where she seemed only too happy to settle into the goddess\u2019 endless red hair. Then her name seeped slowly into the Bear Mother\u2019s consciousness. \u201cDwynen, eh?\u201d The goddess murmured, and the pixie had shivered slightly.\n\n\n\nThe companions looked at the frozen goddess, her bloodied hand still on her face and her breathing now ragged. \u201cF- Flame-haired goddess?\u201d Someone asked hesitantly. There was another growl, and this time members of the band took a wary step back, though Newygnong stood firm and looked on her mother.\n\n\n\u201cThis is Dwyn! Isn\u2019t she just adorable? You\u2019re really good at this creation business, Kippers.\u201d The two other divines had surveyed Dwynen for a few moments, and the one who was not Kippers spoke, launching into what might have been a disparaging tirade.\n\n\u201cI would certainly not use that term, but mayhap there is a facet of a characteristic of a very rough inkling of budding charm to this miniature gargoyle, yes. I would adventure to suggest that this thing is like an empty page, like an unworked piece of wood crying out for the carpenter\u2019s hand, like the unworked field waiting on the coming of the plough. So, in so many words, for I am most certainly loath to bore you, this critter requires but a wise and firm guide and protector so as to augment and uplift it and so unleash and drastically increase the minuscule potential trapped in its comically Lilliputian form.\u201d\n\nThe goddess and Dwynen had given one another a befuddled look, before they both turned back to the god who spoke and Dwynen protested the his words with a few irritated gestures - something about his sire requiring a wise and firm back-handed slap to the gob so as to augment and uplift her. Luckily, the divine in question was no longer paying attention to the pixie and left with some words of thanks. The goddess watched him go with a raised eyebrow. Dwynen plopped herself back onto saffron-haired goddess\u2019 head, looked at insolent god\u2019s turned back for a few moments, and flipped him the bird.\n\n\n\nShe clutched her face, her body shaking and convulsing. Newygnong pressed her black lips together and her eyebrows seemed to furrow ever so slightly. \u201cI think we should get out of here. Now.\u201d She told the others, who all seemed to be in agreement other than Brentylwith.\n\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019S THAT? WHAT A SWEET LIL MORSEL!\u201d She had whispered to Dwyni, leaping behind a nearby bush to peep to her heart\u2019s content.\n\nHer attention was on a newly-emerged god, who had risen from the sand and immediately set to work creating horses. \u201cOh look at him go Dwyni, isn\u2019t he just dreamy?\u201d The faery only giggled and rolled her eyes while fussing over the goddess\u2019 hair in some futile attempt to tidy it. \u201cAwww!\u201d The goddess frowned and pouted. \u201cLook, he just made a baby all on his own. Too tame! So lame. Let\u2019s go Dwyni.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrentylwith made to approach the goddess, but Newygnong placed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head. \u201cI have a bad feeling about this. We should go.\u201d But the King shook his head.\n\n\u201cThe goddess is in pain. She has lost her beloved companion. The least one can do is comfort her a little.\u201d\n\n\nThe goddess inspected the strange winding vines and fungi that Kippers had made, and her crimson hair rippled and extended downwards in long tendrilous tresses. The hairs pierced the fungal growth and went deep into the spiritual marrow of the world.\n\nExcited by the sensations that rippled through her, the goddess closed her eyes and kicked at the empty spaces beneath her floating bare feet and seemed to almost purr. She rose slightly, her hair aglow, and then rose some more, and in an instant she had shot away with a stream of crimson and ethereal golden mist in tow. She traversed the sky in swift steps, her hair spreading from horizon to horizon, and wherever she set foot and wherever she flew, she left in her trail the golden ethereal mist which slowly descended to the ground or made itself comfortable atop a cloud or allowed itself to be carried off on this wind or that wind.\n\nAnd the goddess wheeled about at an impossible angle and dashed very suddenly downward, skimming the surface of the water before hurtling head-first into that first of all forests. 'Watch out!' she shrieked. She disappeared into an exorbitantly large tree before her head emerged from the suddenly glowing and trembling thing. She smiled her broad, hearty smile, and emerged from the giant tree and disappeared into the sky - her crimson hair followed in tow, and a layer of golden mist remained behind and quickly permeated the ground and trees and rocks, the very air, the twigs on the grounds, even the fungal mushrooms that had developed.\n\nThe saffron-haired goddess rode the sky, her naked form twirling in the world\u2019s stratosphere and her peals of laughter thundering across the heavens. At one point she came to a valley full of funny little insects that looked somewhat like the bees of her father\u2019s world, but which she knew were not bees but bizzlebazzles; and the valley was home to trees not at all dissimilar to those present in the first forest. Intrigued, she wandered the skies above the valley, spreading the ethereal golden mists. Pausing to scoop Dwynen, who had just had the roller-coaster ride of her life, into her hands, the goddess twirled in mid-air and ran off into the blue once more, spreading the souls Kipper had made everywhere. The rocks would not simply be rocks, water springs would not simply be springs, trees not mere trees, mountains, the winds, the clouds; everything would have a soul and be filled with mystical magicks and energies.\n\nEventually, once she had taken the souls to the highest peaks and the most unfathomable depths and left no place untouched by the sublime touch of life, the goddess had her hair disentangle itself from the viny fungal soul-maker. She landed she-knew-not-where to discover the ends of her hair had taken on a golden-green sheen due to being inside the fungus. \u201cTHAT\u2019S DISGUSTING!\u201d She cried in horror, trying to scrub the taint from her trademark red hair, but to no avail. \u201cMaybe Kipper\u2019ll know how to get it out,\u201d the goddess said to Dwynen, who was flying around her head in a wonky circle, clearly dazed from the journey. In the pixie\u2019s addled state, the goddess thought she caught her thinking something along the lines of next time, I'm driving. But that made little sense. \u201cLil Grumkin's madness getting to you Dwynkilassi?\u201d The goddess placed a kiss on the faery's little head, and she seemed immediately cured of her travelling sickness. \u201cNow come! Let's go find ol' Kippers and get her to get these horrible colours out!\u201d\n\n\n\nBrentylwith the King approached the grieved goddess, and he placed a hand upon her shoulder to comfort her. On his touch, however, the goddess erupted without warning and turned on him with a sudden fury, her face morphing into a monstrous visage and her form growing threefold, red fur exploding everywhere. And she emitted a dreadful, sonorous growl. There was a vicious, powerful, and swift movement that was over before the King had completely registered it, and he found himself skewered right through the chest with the bear-pommelled Ursus Mater. The force of the strike alone caused the ground beneath Brentylwith to explode into dust, and the Unsullied King was forced from her sight, Ursus Mater still impaling him. The sudden display of divine force shook the mountains, and outside the horrific sound of the world breaking pierced the heavens, and the earth shook, and Mount Blight trembled.\n\nWith that, the saffron-haired goddess turned and \u2013 in a few lithe strides \u2013 exploded from the cave in a flurry of red fur. Newygnong stared after her mother, eyes wide, as the other fae rushed to the King, who was coughing dust and in dire need help. \u201cNewygnong!\u201d Tingalina cried, and the warrioress was torn from her daze and rushed towards the King. \u201cCan\u2019t you do anything?\u201d The warrioress bent down wordlessly and placed one hand on Ursus Mater\u2019s hilt and the other around the wound. Oddly enough, she had felt a tremendous surge of power when the saffron-haired goddess had transformed into that monstrosity, and that power had not faded. She reasoned that it was somehow linked to the goddess\u2019 form, and could ascertain from it that her power and strength was directly linked to the goddess \u2013 when the goddess was mighty, Newygnong grew in strength, and when the goddess was weak (and she was never weak) then Newygnong reasoned it would also manifest in her.\n\nWith her magicks at the most powerful they had ever been, she pulled the blade from Brentylwith\u2019s chest, to a groan and more coughs from the King, and swiftly set about applying her transformation powers on him. She had never attempted to transform others, but it didn\u2019t seem too great a leap from what she had been doing. It was all about rearranging the most basic building blocks of a person\u2019s body. If she could rearrange Brentylwith right, she reckoned he would be healed.\n\nWhen she had done all she could, she told the others to carry the King and, Ursus Mater still in her grip, she led them swiftly out of Mar\u2019s lair and sped into the heavens and away.", "action_results": [{"action": "Next", "result": "\u201cMy mother is still out there, in that monstrous form. I can feel it.\u201d Newygnong said. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave her like that. Something must be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Flame-haired goddess is a mighty divine, I am certain she will be well. The more important matter now is to deal with Mar and his kidnappers. A great host of the strange fae-like creatures made of shadow and darkness has been spotted emerging from Mount Blight. They seem to be headed here, we need to confront them before they reach the forest.\u201d Newygnong would have frowned, if her face was not perpetually sullen anyway.\n\n\u201cI guess the matter can wait.\u201d\n\nAnd so on an eerily silent day, with a thick layer of fog wafting through the untouched forests of the Unsullied, the forces of Brentylwith the King moved forth to do battle with their new and strange foe. Through that fog came Brentylwith the King and his airborne army of five-thousand, and through that fog came Newygnong leading the way forth on land, another five-thousand at her back, Purity severing the tension before her. And they left the Unsullied forest and the fog behind them. One faery, flying high above the marching and flying forces of the Unsullied, raised a conch to her lips and blew, and below her the thousands of warriors massed into formations, Brentylwith\u2019s commands booming unnaturally loud. Faeries dashed to the King, notifying him of swarms of a strange new enemy spotted directly north of them and another swarm to the north-west. The King sent to Newygnong, bidding her direct her forces to the north to face the enemy there. And with Seihdhos raised high, the airborne Unsullied horde followed its King.\n\nThe earth shook beneath the feet of Newygnong\u2019s earthbound regiments, their spears pounding the ground and wickerwork shields brought close. Soon enough the swarming horde of strange dark creatures came into sight, and there was no doubt in Newygnong\u2019s mind that they were utter and absolute killjoys. Very much unlike her. With a few brisk commands to various messenger fae, she had her newly formed army prepare to take on the enemy. Some fifty Eshgaebars with elaborate leafy crowns shouted out orders to their companies as the small messenger faeries rushed from Newygnong to them and conches were blown to bring the entire army to battle readiness.\n\nIn the distance, the shadowy fae came. The shadowy Unsullied flew above their shadowy Sullied counterparts. The latter ran like beasts on the ground, with no signs of stopping or slowing down. Growling, snarling, and howling like mere beasts, the shadowy Sullied charged forth. They came in many different sizes, from small little menaces to hulking monstrosities that nearly matched the Marigs in size. Nearly all of them boasted claws, talons, fangs, and an assortment of other dangerous body parts.\n\nThe blackened and utterly marred shadowy Unsullied, meanwhile, were not quite so animalistic. They retained a semblance of intelligence and organisation, but here too were razor claws and talons, and elongated fangs, to be seen. And as they approached, the shadow Unsullied released songs and hymns with voices that sounded vaguely like those they were before they were marred.\n\nThe familiar sounds alarmed the gathered Unsullied, warriors looked to one another in fear. But Newygnong, who felt their fear, stepped forth and delivered a bloodcurdling cry. And when her cry was over, it did not stop, but seemed to grow louder and ever more terrible. And it resonated on the air and in the winds, a howl unlike anything mortalkind had ever before heard. Newygnong looked about her, eyebrows furrowed, and even the shadowy fae before her and the Unsullied behind her looked about themselves in fear and confusion.\n\nThere was a streak of red across the sky, a cosmic snarl, an echoing growl, a pinprick of blinding white light in an eye of utter darkness. The shadowy fae of Mar\u2019s creation could never have imagined such horror. It tore through them, shredding them from existence, and wherever it suddenly became present great clouds of ash and dust billowed into the overcast heavens as the frail forms of Marred fae were wholly obliterated. They cried out and screeched and yelped and roared, and some tried to escape. But the Bear Mother erased them all.\n\nThe Unsullied and their red-haired commander stared wide-eyed at the display of incomprehensible awing power. The monstrous divine stood on the field, amidst the rising plumes of black dust, and the pinpricks of glaring white light were turned on them. The Bear Mother stepped forward, and Newygnong shrieked out, \u201cretr-!\u201d but it was far too late. The warrioress felt only a great blast of heat and air, and she felt her hair shrivel and burn, as the terrible divine surged and erupted through her gathered host, leaving a great empty passage of golden dust right through its middle. Coughing and bleeding, Newygnong watched as the Unsullied screamed and fled. But the goddess did not return to finish them all and was gone.\n\nAs the Unsullied reeled from the divine horror, Newygnong among what was left of her army. Many were trembling and weeping, and there were those who were huddled on the ground unable to move or even speak, and others were ashen and haggard and their childish faces seemed to have aged and their eyes were sunken in and extinguished. She saw Selsibella, cradled by another fae, grabbing at golden dust while weeping and calling for Tingalina. Gold and jet-black dust intermixed in the air all around. Newygnong walked numbly on, and as she came to the passage of death the Bear Mother had carved into the earth and through her fae, she saw there something crawling. Black and golden dust circled and twisted above and around the crawling thing, and slowly there were hands and feat, calves, torso, arms, a neck, a head, and brilliant red hair.\n\nThe man stood up, and he was as stall as Newygnong, and he looked about in confusion at all the broken fae until he saw Newygnong. \u201cHail there!\u201d His voice boomed. \u201cWhere am I and what terrible thing has happened here?\u201d And as he approached the warrioress felt a great heat coming from him.\n\n\u201cI am Newygnong, and who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Fionnbhar the Blood-head.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cBlood-head?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that I am. In the manner of the Blood-headed One.\u201d He looked around again, \u201cwhere is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Blood-headed One? You mean\u2026 the Flame-haired goddess?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2026 does not seem to be well.\u201d Newygnong said, explaining that the goddess had grown maddened with grief over her pixie companion and appeared to now be on a rampage. \u201cShe seems to be targeting Marred things, but she had no qualms annihilating many others.\u201d And she gestured to the passage of death and golden dust all around. \u201cCome with me. We must speak with Brentylwith the King about this.\u201d\n\nWhen Newygnong and her shell-shocked army, accompanied by Fionnbhar, came upon the King and his army, they saw clear evidence that the Bear Mother had been here too. \u201cThat was the single most horrific thing I have ever witness.\u201d The King told Newygnong, a deep frown on his face. \u201cYou were right. Something must be done about the goddess.\u201d He paused and looked at Fionnbhar. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nNewygnong introduced the Blood-head and explained how he had emerged from the dust and death left behind in the aftermath of the Bear Mother\u2019s rampage. \u201cYou do not seem to be a fae, but you were born of fae remains? This is a divine act, no doubt.\u201d The King mused.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Fionnbhar said. \u201cThe Blood-headed One created me. Wherever there are those in need of defending, there shall I be.\u201d The King nodded and was on the verge of speaking when the earth started shaking and in the distance there was rumbling. In the distance, through the gold and black clouds of dust, all watched as Mount Blight fell. It seemed as though a great, thunderous eruption was rupturing the face of the mountain, sending exploding shards, bits of stone and boulder, everywhere. A great cloud rose up and an avalanche of debris and rock exploded in all directions. The Unsullied stood straight but no less awestruck as the mountain\u2019s song rose up high and its remains ascended like a terrible Leviathan of fire and earth.\n\nBrentylwith watched with eyebrows furrowed and mouth set in a grim, straight line. As the mountain settled they could see lines of dark creatures fleeing in all directions. Sighing deeply, the King called on his Unsullied to gather themselves up and they all began to head for home.\n\nIn the days that followed the King sent faeries to scout out the mountain, and they confirmed that it had been utterly destroyed and was now nothing but a heap of rubble. The fearsome Bear Mother was seen prowling the area, though had not attacked and, if she had noticed them at all, simply ignored them.\n\n\u201cThis needs a hero.\u201d Fionnbar said. \u201cThe Blood-headed One loves and rewards those who go forth and do glorious battle against the odds. I will go forth and I will face her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s foolishness!\u201d The King said, dismissing the suggestion. \u201cYou are a mere mortal. She is war incarnate. You will be going to your death.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will go instead,\u201d Newygnong said. \u201cShe is my mother, I will bring her back from her pit of grief and anger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. The Crimson Goddess destroyed thousands before our eyes. Neither you nor he stand a chance. The best thing to do is leave her be and not approach the remains of the mountain. Time will cure her.\u201d Spoke Brentylwith. The other fae gathered around them spoke also, and after a long time the decision was finally made.", "action_results": [{"action": "Send Fionnbar", "result": "And so brave Fionnbar made ready, and he determined not to return until his quest to end the threat posed by the Bear Mother was accomplished, or he had perished. And though the thought of this saddened Newygnong, she gave the Blood-head the sword of the saffron-haired goddess, Ursus Mater. \u201cThis is a great honour, Newygnong. I will endeavour to be worthy of it.\u201d As he set out, a small green-haired faery approached him.\n\n\u201cAre you going to kill the Crimson Goddess?\u201d She asked.\n\n\u201cI will do whatever is needed to remove her threat.\u201d The Blood-head said.\n\n\u201cShe killed Tingalina. I don\u2019t understand how she could do that when we went with her and helped her find her stupid pixie.\u201d The faery said, tears dropping from her eyes. Fionnbhar was silent for a few seconds, then asked her name. \u201cSelsibella.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cWell, Selsibella. I\u2019m not going out there to avenge you, or anyone else for that matter. I\u2019m going out there because that\u2019s what a Blood-head does.\u201d And with that, Fionnbhar ventured out into the Unsullied forest and beyond, crossing the river of the Unsullied and journeying towards the wrecked Mount Blight. He saw many of the Marred fae as he went, alone or in small groups, and it was not infrequently the case that groups of angry vengeful Sullied would attack them and rend them apart into clouds of black dust. On more than one occasion he stepped forth to defend the Marred and struck the vengeful Sullied down, causing them to scatter and hurl profanities at him.\n\nThe Blood-head paid them no heed, and soon the rubble of Mount Blight was beneath his sandals. He trudged on, Ursus Mater in one hand and a round wicker shield in the other, until at last he came upon the Bear Mother resting on a great boulder. She turned her terrible visage towards him, and the blinding pinpricks of light in her obsidian eyes shone upon him and a low rumble came from her.\n\n\u201cYou are a great and terrible beast, and you have consumed the Blood-headed One. I have come to slay you!\u201d Fionnbhar declared solemnly, raising his shield and pointing his blade at her. The Bear Mother growled and rose to her full height, towering above the puny Blood-head. She took a step, Fionnbhar raised his sword, and then she was gone. There was a snarl to his side, and he turned just as her great claws tore at him. He raised his shield, but it was a laughable gesture. It disappeared from existence, his arm with it. He cried out with pain and rage and struck, and Ursus Mater grazed the goddess and did no harm at all.\n\nHe fell back, his arm gushing blood everywhere, and the beast glared down at him. Then it grabbed him by the leg, spun him over her head, and flung him far away. Fionbharr flew for what seemed like hours until at last he landed in water and disappeared within.

Of course he had failed \u2013 the Blood-headed One was the fount of all might, the manifestation of battle, war incarnate. Who was he, whose own power was bestowed by her, to challenge her? And he was filled with misery at his prior arrogance and stupidity, and he realised that he was in truth nothing at all. His only great and glorious feat was striking down a few vengeful Sullied fae.\n\n\u201cWhat a great and mighty Blood-head you are, Fionnbhar.\u201d He murmured bitterly. And eventually he came to a cave and lit a fire for himself and, finding himself hungry (for he may have been one blessed by the Bear Mother, but he hungered too and grew cold and needed rest and sleep!) he hunted down some rabbits and cooked and ate them before resting. And when he woke he carried on until the sea and all the mountains and caves were left behind him, and wherever he went he was in misery and a constant state of self-reproach.\n\nFor months Fionnbhar journeyed in this state, until one day he came across a purple-headed man in a strange hat. \u201cIt\u2019s a top hat,\u201d the purple-headed man said when he saw the Blood-head staring at it.

Soon enough the Blood-head found himself in a great forest, and as he travelled within, forcing his way through the thick undergrowth, he found it to be full of life and beauty. Animals could be seen, and when not seen they could certainly be heard \u2013 birds of all kinds, strange screeches, insects. At last, as though it were always his destination, he came across a clearing where he felt at utter peace, and he sat there and had no desire for anymore walking and did not want to leave.\n\nAnd he did not, and was undisturbed until some days later a man in long black robes and a wide-brimmed straw hat emerged. There was a sword sheathed at his side and a strange red aura about him, though Fionnbhar did not feel in any particularly danger.

And even as it did, sound erupted all about as yet another god exploded into the world - this one in a cacophonous burst of sound and light and strange singing birds. And it was then that the One Who Mars made his declaration of war against all the gods.\n\n\u201cI am the One Who Mars, and all you make and all you do \u2013 and you yourselves! \u2013 will be marred by me. So go, run, flee, skedaddle, hide wherever you want to hide. I will find you all.\u201d\n\nIn the face of this declaration of war and aggression, the other gods only made conciliatory gestures. The saffron-haired goddess scoffed. \u201cI will not flee, Mario. I am the enduring fire that will sear your marrings from every heart and plain, the sheltering flame against your unwanted perversions. Be afraid, boyo.\u201d And beside her Newygnong stridulated piercingly, and her chitin became as steel, her mandibles grew long and were as adamant, and the Flame-haired goddess sent her forth into the world to be its guardian and to hunt down Mar\u2019s horrors.\n\n\n\nAnd Newygnong had done so, and she had endeavoured through all that to beautify and refine herself so that she became more and more like the beautiful Flame-haired goddess. It was Brahun Dan who helped her final transformation, from an overgrown bug into the beautiful and worthy daughter of the Bear Mother. And now her mother had become\u2026 a monstrosity. It confused Newygnong, for she had always thought her mother\u2019s form was the epitome of perfection. That was why she had aspired towards it. What was this strange new form? Where had it come from? Was it truly an aspect of the Bear Mother? Or was it something else?\n\nNewygnong had no answers, only more and more questions, and when she landed at last on the ruined mountain, she saw the beast her mother had become. The beast turned her terrible visage towards Newygnong, and the blinding pinpricks of light in her obsidian eyes shone upon the warrioress even as she released a low rumble. \u201cMother, it is me, your Newygnong.\u201d The warrioress spoke. The Bear Mother rose to her full height, towering above the comparatively puny Newygnong, and cocked her head. \u201cI know you\u2019re sad. I know you\u2019re angry. And I know you\u2019re there, mother. So come back, come on out of there.\u201d The goddess lowered her head and mewled. \u201cWhat happened was terrible. Dwynen was my first friend too.\u201d The mention of Dwyni\u2019s name caused the goddess\u2019 head to snap up, her eyes to widen and the pinpricks of light therein to shrink. Newygnong flinched, but continued. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t want you to be like this. If she saw you like this, she\u2019d probably run away. This isn\u2019t the you that Dwyni loved.\u201d\n\nThe goddess whined and sat down on her haunches, head down. Newygnong approached and hesitantly placed her palm on the monstrous head of the goddess. \u201cSo, will you come out?\u201d She asked. The goddess looked up, her eyes met Newygnong\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Came a deep growl that took Newygnong by surprise. Then the beast\u2019s maw opened and unleashed a horrendous roar, and it made to snap at Newygnong. But at the last second it seemed to pause, giving the warrioress time to leap away, before the jaws came smashing shut where she had just been. The warrioress leapt into the air even as the beast dashed towards her and grabbed at her leg. Newygnong desperately tried to move it out of the beast\u2019s reach, but it caught her and started to pull her down.\n\n\u201cM-mother!\u201d Newygnong cried desperately, her hand on Purity\u2019s hilt.

The Bear Mother turned her head towards Newygnong, snarling now. She rose and charged, and then disappeared. Newygnong wheeled about just in time to bury her blade into her mother\u2019s neck.

The feud between Sullied and Unsullied had returned with earnest soon after Mount Blight was felled, and the Marred fae joined the chaos of warring with fervour, for it seemed that the One Who Mars had taught this King how to corrupt and mar the minds of Sullied and Unsullied. But the threat of the Marred was nothing as it had been, and this three-way feud was soon the accepted state of affairs.\n\nSatisfied, Brentylwith the King left matters in the capable hands of Fylmira and Elabeen and set out to the Great Unsullied Court to gather his forces and turn his attention to the matter of the Unsullied Court at the Chomp-Munch Plain and the unsatiable god who had enslaved them\u2026", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Grief", "result": "There was a heavy silence for the longest time, and then the goddess sobbed and cried, and then she wailed and grabbed Newygnong in a great hug.

When the goddess quietened somewhat, Brentylwith the King stepped forth and tried to suggest they leave the lair, but then the goddess suddenly started tearing up again.\n\nNewygnong held her and gave the King a stony glare to quieten him.

In time Marred faeries and Marigs began to come into the lair or emerge from deep within, causing the goddess\u2019 fae companions to cry out in fear.

When they emerged, they found the goddess weeping outside. Newygnong made to move towards her, but she turned and wiped her tears. \u201cYou had better leave.\u201d She said, and her voice was hard and her eyes were on the cave.\n\n\u201cAre you not coming with us, mother?\u201d Newygnong asked.

And turning around, the band watched with horror as Mount Blight fell. It seemed as though a great, thunderous eruption was rupturing the face of the mountain, sending exploding shards, bits of stone and boulder, everywhere. A great cloud rose up and an avalanche of debris and rock exploded in all directions.\n\nThe Unsullied stood straight but no less awestruck as the mountain\u2019s song rose up high and its remains ascended like a terrible Leviathan of fire and earth.

It had not been difficult at all, in truth, the Matriarch appearing to see no issue with casually meeting her archnemesis. In truth, he did not feel entirely comfortable about it. He had met the Matriarch in battle before, and she (or any Sullied for that matter) could not be trusted. She may well have agreed to this meeting in bad faith, intending to use it as an opportunity to strike him down or something of the sort.

Brentylwith could see those who bested and ate others growing in size and strength, and the death-feast only came to a stop when Asula\u2019s voice rose above the chaos of growling and screeching and screaming to bring them all to order. \u201cGo feast on the greatest and strongest of all, my dears, and bring me Old Sword-Mother\u2019s hair!\u201d\n\nThe parbreakborn looked at her in confusion, having only now noticed her there. One darted before the Matriarch and looked at her, prodding her blue skin. The Sullied glowered down at him and spread her wings, and before the unfortunate parbreakborn could ready himself her claws had ripped into his throat and caused him to explode into dusty away. A great cry rose from the others, and a particularly big parbreakborn dashed forth and sucked up all the dust before towering in front of the Matriarch. They stared at one another for a few silent moments, and then the mouth of the parbreakborn spread open, and thousands of razor teeth appeared. The Matriarch scowled and bared her fangs at him. His grin grew, and then his great jaw fell open and snapped up the first of the fae.\n\nBrentylwith the King drew Seihdhos and swiftly backed away from the horror being birthed at the pond.

His Unsullied had been surprised when he informed them about the meeting, for he had endeavoured to keep it a secret from all, and he could feel their apprehension as they approached the great oak where the meeting was to take place. It was roughly halfway between the Sullied and Unsullied rivers, making it an acceptable neutral location.\n\nWhen the King and his Unsullied arrived, they found Asula already there. The blue-skinned Matriarch was sat in the branches of the glorious oak, staring down at them with a raised eyebrow. \u201cDidn\u2019t know this was a party, Bren.

At best, a swift detection of a particular attack allowed Unsullied warriors to hunt down the raiders.\n\nThe worst thing was that the Sullied did it for no reason other than the thrill of it.
