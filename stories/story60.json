Your heavy boots trudge along stones as you stroll up the path to the old log cabin ahead of you. A pump-action shotgun sits in your hand, a solid determination clear in each of your steps.\n\n\nYou survey the cabin, eyes watching for any movements ahead of you. The cabin looks run-down, and you'd have guessed it'd be abandoned if you didn't know better. The cold air prickles your face, so you grab your balaclava, pulling it up over your mouth and nose.\n\n\nYou reach the old wooden door at the front of the lodge. Quickly checking your safety and checking you have everything for the third time, you loosen your shoulders and take a deep breath. Raising your hand, you rap your knuckles against the door. A few moments later, you hear a raspy voice call out through the door, as an eye peers through the eye hole at you.\n\n\n\"Minski Kuzkin?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Hello?\" a thick Russian voice answers.\n\n\nYou step back, raising your shotgun and blasting it through the door. You hear a horrified scream, and have to actively suppress any trace of empathy that peaks through. You pump your shotgun, the shell flying to the ground as you blow away the door hinges, before booting the door. You step through the door, finding a pathetic looking figure in tattered, filthy rags, blood soaking through them and pooling on the floor around him. The stench hits you then, the air so heavy with rot and pestilence that you have to gag. The man seems to be in his mid-to-late forties, although you know he's barely in his thirties. His ogre-like frame, no doubt intimidating normally, is now huddled up as he desperately tries to stem the bleeding. You stroll forward, pressing your boot against the man's neck as you aim your shotgun at his chest.\n\n\n\"If you have any weapons on you, it'll be a lot easier if you tell me now.\"\n\n\n\"You twisted fuck! You goddamn...!\"\n\n\nYou pump the shotgun, a shell flying to the ground. The noise quietens Minski's complaints to a pained whimpering.\n\n\n\"I don't,\" he answers, his voice a mere whimper.\n\n\n\"Good,\" you answer, grabbing a pair of silver handcuffs from your belt. \n\n\nYou grab Minski's arm, forcing them behind his back as you cuff him. He screams again as you roll him onto his stomach, but a quick knee to the head quietens him again.\n\n\nYou stand, taking a deep breath, your resolve in your duty strengthening.\n\n\n\"Wh-who are y-you?\" Minski asks.\n\n\n\"I hunt monsters, Mr Kuzkin. Vampires, banshees, werewolves, wraiths, changelings, demons... you get the drift.\"\n\n\nMinski lets out a cold, cruel laugh, his demeanor changing.\n\n\n\"Aah... I see. You've finally found me, after all these years. You've sensed my presence. You're after the demon that burns inside my soul. I've been waiting for someone like you.\"\n\n\nYou don't even bother to look at the man, instead taking a step into the lounge kitchen, your fears confirmed. At that moment, you're glad you're wearing a balaclava.\n\n\nA badly burned body lies on the kitchen table, its face mutilated beyond recognition. The body's small, the victim not much older than fourteen. The smell is unbearable, filling the house. You look away, the sight burning into your retinas even after your years of doing this.\n\n\n\"You twisted fuck,\" you mutter, gritting your teeth.\n\n\nYou blink long and hard, trying to regain a semblance of your cold, methodical, professional demeanor, before looking down at Minksi.\n\n\n\"The demons tear at me, scream at me to do it! It's how you make them stop!\"\n\n\nYou sigh, fingers dancing on the trigger as you aim it at the man's head.\n\n\n\"Demons are real, Mr Kuzkin, but they're rare, and they don't plague you. I thought they might've. It's why I investigated you. But you're not one of the poor souls cursed to deal with them. You're an animal. A pathetic creature so wracked with insanity and hatred that you take it out on the world. You're a mental case, an animal that needs to be put down, a... a...\" you pause, looking to find the right words. \"A monster.\" \n\n\n\"No, no, they're here! They talk to me, they tell me things, they...!\"\n\n\n\"Quiet,\" you say, your voice barely above a whisper, but still controlling the room.\n\n\nThe man's lost in his deluded fantasies, he's not worth talking to. Even though you doubted you would, you'd hoped that you could find some traces of demonic possession here, so you could help the poor man, but no, unfortunately you've only found yourself on the trail of another psychopath rather than any real supernatural presence.\n\n\n\"I... I didn't want to! I tried to fight them, but they wouldn't let me stop! I couldn't sleep, couldn't... couldn't eat, couldn't... I... I just...\" \n\n\nThe pathetic figure breaks into sobbing, as you decide what to do. A quick call to the police station, and an officer could come out here to find their job done for them, the evidence lying around the house with their suspect neatly tied up. Minski would no doubt escape with the insanity plea, where he'd be taken to an institution to see if his shattered mind could be pieced together over days and months and years and decades.... of course, with your rifle belies an easier, more just answer.", "action_results": [{"action": "Kill Minski Kuzkin", "result": "You tilt your head, staring down the sights of your shotgun as you still your breath. With that, you pull the trigger. The shotgun bucks, Minski's head shattering as gray brain matter and bits of skull flies across the room. You don't flinch, simply wiping off what bits of skull land upon you. The sight of death and sound of gunfire are both as familiar as old friends to you, and you shan't be spooked by their visit.\n\n\n\"And so ends the tale of Minski the Muscovite,\" you remark.\n\n\nYou turn, walking to the nearest bedroom, searching for the cleanest sheets you could find. Taking a pair of brown sheets from the bed, you walk back into the kitchen, where the flies are having a feast. Your eyes water, and even you can't tell if it's from the smell or the sight. Carefully laying the sheet across the body, you step back, bowing your head as a matter of respect.\n\n\n\"It's OK, boy. The horrors are over,\" you whisper.\n\n\nYour job finished, you turn, heading out to your truck outside. You walk out to the old, beaten gray pick-up, your eyes peering to the back where a pair of red diesel cannisters lie. It's a struggle to know whether to use them. This deep in the woods, you could burn this whole fucking place to the ground, and destroy any evidence of what happened here. Part of you thinks that no one should have to know what happened here. The dull city of Bergen should just continue in its sweet, sweet bliss.\n\n\nYou'd happily burn away any memory of Minski the Muscovite, but the boy leaves a pressing question. Perhaps he deserves a right to have his tale told, to be returned home for a proper burial. And of course, his parents deserve a right to know, don't they? But, then again... perhaps it's better they don't know. Perhaps they live in eternal hope that their boy was just another runaway, or suffered an accidental death rather than the awful fate he held. No parent deserves to see their beautiful boy in the state that that boy is now.", "action_results": [null, null]}]}
