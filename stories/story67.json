You have recently finished your daily chores when you hear a terrifying scream.  Your village is known for suffering frequent hit and run attacks from the creatures in the mountainside and those that get taken never come back.  By the time you get there, it is already too late.  And to make matters worse, it was your little sister that was taken this time.  You've been dealing with this shit your whole life, but this is the last straw.  Somebody has to take care of those foul beasts!\n\n \nYou pick up a pitchfork only to be stopped by the gentle hand on your shoulder.  You turn and see Brandolf the Bray gazing down at you from behind a beard that is quickly encompassing his whole face.  He tells you that to stop the monsters you must focus on assassinating the Craxil, for without their leader the rest will likely vacate the area (or at least fall into disunity making them easier for the local militia to handle individually). \n\n \n \n \n Many other villagers have arrived on the scene and they obviously share the same sentiments as you.  Seeing the looks in their eyes, Brandolf decides he's going to have to organize a council meeting to discuss the matter before anyone gets it in their mind to do anything stupid. \n\n \n ", "action_results": [{"action": "To The Council Meeting Then", "result": "Brandolf the Bray manages to convince the townspeople to stow their torches and pitchforks and agree to a council meeting but it is clear from everyone's faces that they would not accept any outcome that did not involve taking immediate action.  Brandolf's magic may be formidible, but against a numerous and organized foe he would not get far.  The townspeople (yourself included) are but farmers and peasants and would be hardpressed to slay a hackneyed donkey, let alone a monster.\n\n \nMost of the creatures that come out of the mountains are lumbering, humanoid creatures that stand about 10 feet tall and are covered by brown fur from head to toe.  They have a hunch in their backs, and the villagers have taken to calling them humunculi.  While these creatures are certainly new to you, you are warned that there are even more dangerous creatures lurking in the depths of the mountainside.  Now you begin to look at the towering rockface with a mixture of curiosity and dread.\n\n \n\"We need to deal with this Craxil thing NOW\" an angry voice shouts.  \"How long must be culled before the royal military arrives to aid us?\"\n\n \nOf course, the royal military they speak of is from the kingdom of Mihtana, which is a considerable distance away.\n\n \n\"The royal military has never been willing to send any military force out to our village, why should this be any different?\"\n\n \nThis comment is true, you think.   The village of Jacquescrappe is a considerable distance away from civilization and the kingdom of Mihtana sees it as being of no strategic value.  Even if it was under direct threat of annihiliation, you doubt anyone would go through the trouble of committing a significant military force out to such a far away place.  In fact, Brandolf is the only outsider that has bothered to help the village in a long time.\n\n \nThe rest of the townspeople immediately begin arguing over whether they should stay and defend the land of their ancestors or simply leave.  Others put forth ideas on how to trap the Craxil that are quickly dismissed by Brandolf as stupid.  Suddenly, Brandolf makes an announcement. \n\n \n\"I have a poison, aquired from an alchemist in Lima, that can kill the Craxil.  Even trace amounts of this deadly substance can kill even the largest of creatures\".\n\n \n ", "action_results": [null]}]}
