Your heart no longer beats and you can't move a muscle. Congratulations, you are dead. But not for long. You hazily recall your last moments...\n\n\nWalking through the nightclub you see an ocean of flesh moving rhythmically to the blasting music. You see the women wearing skirts so short that you wonder how it's legal. Two people however catch your interest the most. A woman of about 20 something is sitting at the bar staring off into the distance. She is wearing a purple dress that ends at her upper thighs. Her alabaster skin looks smoother than porcelain. Her fine blonde hair is like a river of gold. You are immediately attracted to her but as you make your way through the crowd you spot another beauty. At about midway to the woman in the purple dress you spot another one at the opposite end of the bar. This one is wearing a low cut top (that is quite tight fitting) and a miniskirt, she radiates sexiness. She is also quite pale and has fiery red hair and catches you staring at her. She gives a small smile and then looks away. The old divining rod is no help here so who's it gonna be?", "action_results": [{"action": "The girl at the bar", "result": "\"Hi,\" You say followed by whatever cheesy pickup line that comes to mind. Surprisingly it works and you get her attention. Her emerald eyes seem full of life and she looks hungrily at you, almost licking her lips for you. Obviously a good sign. After about an hour of conversing you learn that she lives nearby and she invites you back to her place. And you thought today would suck (All puns intended). You leave the club and follow her back to her place. Turns out she lives in a pretty tidy and sparse apartment down the road from the club. She leaves you on her couch to go \"slip into something more comfy\" and goes into what looks like her bedroom. Feeling like you just won the lottery you begin to check out her apartment, it's pretty empty except for a desk with some papers on it and a bookcase. The desk looks like it has newspaper clippings on it and the bookcase has some strange looking books on it. Feeling a little paranoid what do you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Search the bookcase", "result": "After looking through the titles of the book you find that they are all on vampire myths and legends. However there is one that catches your eye out of all of them, it is labeled as \"Diary of a vampire\" and it intrigues you. Looking through the diary you find that it mentions a nightclub and a gullible guy with cheesy pickup lines trying to get into the owner's panties. The owner of the diary then goes into detail of how they want to dismember the guy after they drain them. You are horrified to find all of the similarities and find that you only have two choices you can either confront \"Sarah\" as she signs at the bottom of the diary or you can run for your life. Which do you choose?", "action_results": [{"action": "Run away fast as you can", "result": "Unfortunately you can't run away from a vampire that easily. The blonde tracks you down, drains you of blood, and snaps your neck. You die as a human and do not rise again.", "action_results": []}, null]}, null, null]}]}
