It either is or it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno I lost the list.\u201d\n\u201cYou what? That\u2019s just great. You realize how much we\u2019re going to get our asses chewed out because of your fuck up? I\u2019m sick of paying for your mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cWill you calm down? How the hell are they gonna know anyway? You seen one ugly little baldy, you\u2019ve seen \u2018em all. All babies look the same.\u201d\n\u201cNot the elven ones.\u201d\n\u201cEnough with your elf fetish. These babies are all under the care of the Empire anyway, they\u2019re here for the taking.\n\u201cYeah, the key word being the Empire. You know we need the proper paper work, which you just fucking lost!\u201d\n\u201cSo what, I can forge it. You really worry too much, there\u2019s so much red tape they ain\u2019t gonna know the difference and what does it matter? The Empire\u2019s getting a body for their purposes anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you know how they like the best.\u201d\n\u201dHow the fuck can they really tell at this age? They do all the real testing later. Look he\u2019s got all his limbs, and he doesn\u2019t display any signs of impurity. I\u2019d say he\u2019s a prime candidate for whatever they have in store for this poor little bastard.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess\u2026damn. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like being brought up like that.\u201d\n\u201cMe either, this program has only been going on a few years, but I\u2019ve already heard some fucked up stories about it\u2026y\u2019know its things like this that sometimes make me question the logic of our glorious leaders.\u201d\n\u201cShhhh! Are you mad? Don\u2019t talk like that! It\u2019s not our place to question anything, we\u2019re just supposed to do our jobs! Besides, the logic is quite obvious. If they train people from birth they\u2019ll have superior combat skills and utter loyalty to the Empire.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point though. Is it really necessary? The Empire already produces so much propaganda that it does the job pretty well in producing loyal citizens and if that doesn\u2019t work it also instills so much fear in most that even if someone wanted to start a rebellion; it\u2019s highly unlikely they would.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure, it has happened in the past.\u201d\n\u201cThe past? When? Like four hundred years ago when the Empire was still in its own infancy? Pfft. Wouldn\u2019t happen anymore and as for having elite combat troops, again what\u2019s the point? We\u2019ve already got camps to train elite groups like the Shadow Guard who are not to be fucked with and we have more than enough resources to create an army of golems that would be just as loyal and kick the shit out of our enemies.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore! Our superiors have their reasons, as does the Emperor! Let us just take this baby and be done with this task!\u201d\n\nThe two clerks left the infirmary with you that day where upon you were accepted as a suitable candidate and put into The Eternal Program.\n\nYou don\u2019t remember too much during the time of your very young years, except that you are mostly confined to a room where all your basic needs are met. On a daily basis, a couple bigger people come in to check on you. They have you perform various physical tasks as well as spending time to teach you things like basic reading and writing. Sometimes they ask you various questions and write down your responses while other times they come in and stab you with painful needles with fluid in them. (You don\u2019t like those times)\n\nYou don\u2019t really understand it all, except that you know that the Emperor is always watching you. He is everywhere even if you don\u2019t see him. He is keeping an eye on your actions and you must always obey his will, lest you be punished. You know this to be true because you have this repeatedly told to you.\n\nEventually your relative isolation would come to an end.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years later\u2026", "result": "Year 5\n\nYou are sitting in a gray room at a desk with several other children your age. All of you glance at each other a lot and it is obvious that there is much curiosity, but nobody speaks. This is very unusual for you, up until now, you have only had minimal contact with others. Most of them are male like you, but a few of them are female.\n\nSoon the silence comes to an end when a dark skinned woman walks into the room. She has long hair and sharp features. One thing you notice is that despite her long hair covering her ears you can still see that the tips of them are pointed. She must be elven, but in the pictures you\u2019ve seen in books, you\u2019ve never seen one with dark skin before.\n\n\u201cHello children, and congratulations on maintaining dignified silence during your time by yourselves. It\u2019s nice to see that your previous human minders aren\u2019t totally incompetent. Still, if you were Svelk children you would\u2019ve been much better trained by now. Ah, but it is not my place to dwell on the limitations of the lesser born. I am merely here to oversee your training into proper Eternals so that you may serve the Emperor to your fullest capabilities. Now before we begin, I suggest you all ask questions now, because this will probably be the only time I will be in the mood for your ignorance.\u201d\n\nFor a moment nobody speaks, but when the elven lady insists, one brave soul raises their hand.\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you an elf?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am. While the ignorant would use the vulgar term dark elf to describe me, my kind are more properly known as the Svelk. In fact WE are the purest of the elven race. All others you may have the misfortune of meeting are merely diluted members of our bloodline. They are truly pitiful creatures really only fit for extermination. Remember this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is unimportant, but you and the rest will always address me as Mistress. Failure to do so will earn my wrath, and more importantly the wrath of the Emperor. Remember this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you teach us?\u201d\n\nA second passes after the question, when a small bolt of light from the Svelk\u2019s finger tips and hits the child in the chest asking the question. He falls backwards out of his chair and on to the floor. The rest of you jump in your own chairs and look back at him. He is breathing very erratically.\n\n\u201cI will teach you to OBEY my commands when I give them!\u201d Mistress shouts, she then warns the rest of you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch him, let alone help him! (Sigh) And here I thought you lot had been trained better! It occurs to me that I will have to be extra strict in my discipline. As to the question about what I will teach you\u2026 I will teach you to be warriors. I will teach you to be wizards if you display the talent. I will teach you to shed yourselves of weakness. I will teach you to serve the Emperor without question and kill without mercy and you will always obey for you will find strength in obedience. You will find joy in order. You will find love in murder. You shall be instruments of terror and genocide if he so wishes it. You will be Eternals\u2026or you will die. Remember this.\u201d\n\nAfter Mistress\u2019 speech, the child she struck down eventually struggles back up and gets back in his seat, clutching his chest and still wheezing.\n\n\u201cI trust you have learned your lesson?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2026yes\u2026Mistress\u2026\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cGood, now one more question before we begin\u2026you there. What is your question? Speak up!\u201d Mistress demands while pointing at you, though you have not raised your hand.\n\nYou don\u2019t wish to disagree with Mistress, so you stumble and try to think up a question.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026er\u2026I was just wondering when will you teach us to fight Mistress?\u201d\nMistress raises an eyebrow and gives a smirk as she approaches you.\n\u201cFight? And what makes you think that YOU are even ready to learn yet? Do you have even the slightest knowledge of combat tactics?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mis\u2026\u201d before you can even complete the sentence Mistress knocks you out of your chair with a quick jab with her hand, the pain from your face spreads to your chest when Mistress steps on it with her boot. She digs it into you and presses all her weight on it, while the rest of your class looks on.\n\n\u201cDamn right, no you don\u2019t. You weren\u2019t even alert enough to anticipate my attack. You let me get in close and now look at you, you\u2019re completely at my mercy. I am in a position to do whatever I like with you, while you are only in a position to beg or die. So what will it be worm? Are you going to beg for your miserable life, or should I save the Empire\u2019s time and money by killing you now?\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Beg", "result": "The pain is great and you want it to be over with as quickly as possible so you cry out and scream for mercy to Mistress. To this, she merely laughs cruelly and continues to step on your chest.\n\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! If this was a real fight do you think an enemy would should you mercy? You truly are pathetic, how did the Empire ever decide that YOU would be a worthy candidate to be an Eternal? Begging for your wretched life as if it was important. It isn\u2019t. Your life is nothing! ALL of your lives are nothing! Your lives will never be anything more than warm bodies to serve the Emperor! The question is, will you even be able to live up to that honored status? The answer is no, if you do not learn mercy is for the weak. Remember this.\u201d\n\nAt this point Mistress finally takes her foot off of you and much like your other classmate hit by her magic bolt, you slowly get up and back in your seat, clutching your chest. You sniffle and try to keep yourself from crying, but the tears are still there. A glare from Mistress causes you to quickly wipe your eyes and try to compose yourself the best you can.\n\nTime passes by under the harsh guidance of Mistress. She teaches you all that she promised she would and then some. Your lessons are not only that of a combat nature, but of an academic one as well. You wouldn\u2019t be aware of it, but you and your classmates are probably much better educated than other children your age.\n\nAs for you, Mistress never lets you forget of how you begged for your life in front of everyone. While it is true that she sadistically taunts everyone at one time or another, it doesn\u2019t make your emotional and psychological scars go away.\n\nThis shame you experience causes you to become more insecure and you constantly feel the need to prove to everyone that you aren\u2019t weak. When you are called upon to spar with your fellow classmates, you always fight aggressively. For the most part you usually win, and you typically break a few bones of some of your fellow classmates. The lessons of being humiliated by Mistress have not been forgotten. You can\u2019t ever let yourself be put in a vulnerable position again and you must be brutal, it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be able to please the Emperor.\n\nYour personality doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by your instructor and watchers, they make note of it and decide how you should be handled in the next step of your training.\n\nYear 12\n\nYou are in a room with a few of your fellow classmates standing in a row. Most of your class has been separated for reasons unknown to you. All you know right now is there is a scarred orc in worn battle armor arguing with a well dressed man who is human. They are speaking about you, but not actually speaking TO you\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat? I thought the whole point of this program was to create an elite fighting group like the Shadow Guard, why are you splitting them up and intending to put some of them in regular military units?\u201d the orc questions.\n\u201cThings have changed since the program\u2019s inception. Besides, if the latest military reports are any indication I\u2019d say you could use a better quality of recruits, or at least I hope that\u2019s the problem and it isn\u2019t due to a lack of proper training.\u201d the man dressed in black formal wear calmly retorts.\n\u201cHey! I train every grunt I get to be the best killer they can be! I\u2019ve conquered more territory for the Empire than anyone! My record speaks for itself and I could do a hell of a lot more if you put me on the front lines again, so don\u2019t try to tell me I\u2019m not doing my fucking job!\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d say you still could benefit by having a few Eternals in your ranks, if nothing else than to be a good example.\u201d\n\u201cGood example? HAH! We haven\u2019t even seen one of these so-called Eternals in action yet! It\u2019s all been just speculation, and a waste of time and money if you ask me! The Empire should be providing better equipment and more of it, for soldiers on the Rask Frontier, it\u2019s a fucking meat grinder out there and we\u2019re constantly having to put down rebellions by the natives.\u201d\n\u201cWell nobody ASKED you, captain and your problems are not mine to deal with. This is the Emperor\u2019s project and he has his reasons. If I were you I\u2019d watch your tone. Victories or not, you are a servant of the Emperor and you will obey orders or you will be replaced.\u201d\n\nThe orc captain steps back from the well dressed man then he takes a deep breath, before speaking.\n\n\u201cYou are lucky that I do serve the Emperor, for that is the only thing keeping me from ripping out your throat, human\u2026very well I shall take these so called Eternal whelps, but let it be known that I shall be testing them to the limit and then some. If they fail, they shall die like anyone else unable to keep up.\u201d\n\u201cAs you wish commander, I leave it in your capable hands. You will keep me apprised of their progress on a weekly basis. Good day.\u201d The well dressed man says and leaves the room, leaving you all alone with the orc commander. You\u2019ve never seen a real orc in person before, but he looks every bit as intimidating from what you\u2019ve read about them, even if he is much more articulate than you expected.\n\nHe walks up and down the row sizing you all up before speaking.\n\n\u201cI am Captain Gruz, and I will be in charge of the rest of your training until the Emperor deems otherwise. I imagine that your former instructor was that dark elven bitch, so I trust you all know by now that failure and weakness have no place here. Correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes Captain!\u201d you all shout in unison.\n\u201cHeh, well glad to see her skills in teaching discipline are still as effective as ever. Good. Now let\u2019s see how good your combat skills are\u2026\u201d\n\nAt this point you and your fellow classmates instinctively start to pair up to spar with each other, but Gruz stops you.\n\n\u201cWhat are you lot doing? I didn\u2019t tell you to get out of formation!\u201d\n\u201cBut captain, you said to prove our combat skills.\u201d One boy speaks up.\n\u201cI\u2026oh wait I see. She had you fighting each other. Typical dark elven training. Create mistrust and loathing even when there is no need for it. (Sigh) I can see I\u2019m going to have to undo some of the shit she instilled in you if I\u2019m going to mold you into the proper killing tools.\u201d\n\nTime goes by and Captain Gruz begins to train you in various forms of combat, though it\u2019s different. He teaches you and your classmates to fight as a team. This usually involves various large beasts similar to what you have already fought or even small groups of goblinoids. It takes awhile for you to adapt, but after seeing the first couple of casualties, you and the rest manage to pull together to defeat your enemies.\n\nAcademically speaking, you are not taught much. Captain Gruz figures that Mistress taught you enough math and literacy to get by in life. Besides not much need for all that fancy learnin\u2019 stuff when you\u2019re going to be chopping people\u2019s heads off on the battlefield.\n\nCaptain Gruz is just as uncompromising as Mistress in his training, but he seems less gleeful about it. His verbal abuse is more direct and to the point rather than gloating about your failures. He still reminds you all regularly about how it is your sworn duty to serve the Emperor, but you hardly need him to tell you that, to believe otherwise is unthinkable.\n\nAs for you, you find yourself given a role of leadership. Captain Gruz noted your tendency to be one of the first to charge into battle. He however also has some advice for you.\n\n\u201cI respect your desire for battle, but if you do not control your insecurities you will one day find yourself needlessly unprepared. I suspect that dark elven bitch did something humiliating to you that has resulted in your behavior. Effective in some ways I suppose, but if you truly want to be a leader of men and command respect, you need to master your emotions as you would your weapons. You must do away with insecurities and be fully confident in your abilities. You must walk into battle already KNOWING that you will win, not charging in with a chip on your shoulder with some misguided desire to prove yourself. That\u2019s a quick way to get yourself killed. Contrary to popular belief, your goal is NOT to die for the Emperor. Your goal is to survive and make the other dumb bastards die so that you may continue to serve the Emperor. Think on this when you lead your fellows into your next training assignment.\u201d\n\nThe captain\u2019s words carry much weight with you and in the years during your training you manage to purge most of your doubts about yourself as well as becoming an accomplished warrior.\n\nYour instructor and watchers once again note your growth and skills, and as usual they make decisions on how you will best serve the Emperor.", "action_results": [{"action": "Years pass\u2026", "result": "Year 16\n\nYou are called into Captain Gruz\u2019s office, when you arrive you see the well dress man that you saw four years ago standing with him\u2026 and debating with him again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you Mr. Mol, I think they should work in the same unit. They\u2019ve trained together and they\u2019ve worked together so well at this point that splitting them up would be folly. Hell, these people have known each other since birth! You know that better than anyone!\u201d Gruz says.\n\u201cYes, captain I\u2019m well aware of the situation, and normally I might agree if their were more of them, but I think their expertise would better serve if we deployed them separately in problem areas of the Empire.\u201d Mr. Mol replies.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t break up a well oiled machine! I guarantee having them all in the same unit will be a better idea. I mean we still haven\u2019t sent them into a real battle yet! Wouldn\u2019t it be better to see if they can get the job done first before placing them in charge of others?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what a perfect opportunity to lose them all, if something unexpected should happen.\u201d\n\u201cOh for\u2026look that could\u2019ve happened here! And if you\u2019re so worried about them all getting killed in battle then what was the fucking point then? Besides, if they do prove to be useless in battle, better we find that out sooner rather than later when they\u2019re in charge of others and getting them killed as well!\u201d\n\nMr. Mol thinks for a moment and then replies.\n\n\u201cHmmm, very well you do have a point captain. We\u2019ll try it your way at first and go from there. Have them deployed in the Nalin province. Your services here have been useful as ever. Good day.\u201d\n\nMr. Mol, steps out and commander Gruz addresses you.\n\n\u201cWell you heard all that, you and your fellow Eternal babies are being sent to the Nalin province. It\u2019s not the Rask Frontier, but it\u2019s a suitable first challenge for you guys. We\u2019ve been trying to settle the conquest of that place for a few years now, and technically it is part of the Empire, but we\u2019re still having problems with the Kobold population there. Little bastards are determined to resist and have been conducting a fairly effective guerilla war since we arrived. Though I blame that more on the incompetence of the commander in that region. If I was stationed there, this shit would\u2019ve been taken care of a long time ago\u2026but I\u2019m not, so unfortunately you will have to report to Captain Pollo.\u201d\n\nCaptain Gruz approaches you closer before continuing.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m putting you in charge of your unit for reasons I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of. While I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve made the right choice, the burden will ultimately be on you to prove to be an effective leader. Remember, you\u2019re not just a normal soldier, you\u2019re supposed to be an Eternal. An instrument of destruction ordered by the Emperor himself. Failure is never an option for you. Even now there are rumors about your kind, and when you finally show yourselves you will be met by fear, awe, hatred and even distain. Prove yourselves and you will live up to the name that your were given. Anyway, the caravan picking you up will arrive tomorrow. Good luck and dismissed.\u201d\n\nWith this you leave and tell the rest of your people about where you\u2019re going and the general nature of what to expect. They all seem pretty excited to prove themselves, and to be honest so are you. At last you will get the chance to prove yourself and can only imagine that the Emperor will be pleased by what he will see.\n\nThe next day, you and your unit are picked up and the ride there is uneventful, but your unit spends a little time talking about things they see on the way. This is the first time all of you have probably been away from the training center you\u2019ve spent all your lives in. Curiosity about some of the surroundings is natural, but it isn\u2019t just the casual talk that\u2019s different.\n\nYour comrades are different. They are less reserved than they once were. Captain Gruz might\u2019ve been a strict instructor, but in addition to encouraging teamwork he was also prone to encourage you guys to have a few hours of free time. This loosening of the reigns a bit, allowed a certain amount of familiarity with each other that wasn\u2019t just on a professional level anymore. Even you have felt yourself changing personality wise.\n\nStill you are all Eternals, and you are loyal to the Emperor. You will never forget that your duty comes first.\n\nEventually you all arrive at Fort Glory in the Nalin province where you are stared at by several soldiers who whisper among themselves. None of you pay it any mind though, you simply report to Captain Pollo. He doesn\u2019t look anything like Captain Gruz. He\u2019s human for one thing and wears lighter armor which is impeccably clean. When he sees you, he almost looks bored, like you were interrupting him, but you when you came in he was reclined in his chair and not doing anything of importance.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026you are the Eternals I\u2019ve heard so much about. Humph. I don\u2019t see anything special except that pretty one over there. Oh no, not you dear. That blonde muscular one in the back. Yes, delicious.\u201d Captain Pollo says pointing to one of your men and not even getting out of his chair.\n\n\u201cCaptain Pollo, we are here for our assignments so that we may serve the Emperor.\u201d You say.\n\u201c(Sigh) I suppose you are this unit\u2019s leader?\u201d\n\u201c Yes, captain. I am currently their leader and holding the rank of sergeant due to my excellence in my training exercises.\u201d\n\u201cSergeant? YOU? Why you\u2019re a mere boy! All of you are just children! I ask them for more men and they send me children! The only thing you all would be good for is cleaning the fort! In fact that\u2019s what you can go do right now, starting with the toilets!\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what Captain Gruz said would happen. This is your first test.\n\n\u201cCaptain, we have been trained in several forms of combat and fully ready to fight. Send us into battle and we will prove ourselves. We are here to perform our duty for the Emperor and all that entails.\u201d\n\u201cAll that entails eh? Okay, you want a fight? A few miles east of here, you\u2019ll find a town called Dalt. Its filled with ignorant peasants that constantly whine to us that there are a nest of kobolds lurking in the hills near them. We\u2019re stretched out as it is and can\u2019t spare anymore troops to waste on towns that are of no military importance in the grand scheme of things. Go there and take care of their problem, then maybe we\u2019ll have more to talk about.\u201d\n\nYou nod and all of you leave, but before you are able to Pollo calls you back.\n\n\u201cOh one more thing sergeant. Order one of your men to stay here with me. I think you know by now which one I mean.\u201d\n\nAt this point you\u2019re in genuine shock. You may be young, and even a little detached from normal \u2018society\u201d but you know exactly what Captain Pollo is implying. You can honestly feel more than surprised by this though.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I will need all of my team to have the best chance to succeed in this mission.\u201d You say.\n\u201cOh? Well sorry, but you\u2019ll have to make do like everyone else here does. Or you could clean the fort like I first ordered you to do, which you chose to ignore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a no win situation, though you try to figure out a loophole that takes the responsibility off of you.\n\n\u201cCaptain, you are of a higher rank than me, surely you could just order him yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, nice try. No. You want to be a leader of men? You need to make this decision yourself. Tis quite easy I would think. Sacrifice one for the good of the rest. If anything I\u2019d say he\u2019s the lucky one. He gets to stay here enjoying the pleasures of the flesh, and won\u2019t have to be mucking about with kobolds and dealing with idiotic peasants.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave him behind", "result": "Unfortunately Pollo is right, the only decision that makes sense is to leave Gerald behind.\n\nStill, you aren\u2019t fond of the idea though not necessarily for the moral reasons that most would be. This is an unproductive use of your team\u2019s talents and pointless in the scheme of things. You can\u2019t believe the Empire would allow such a petty man to be in charge of the safety of a province and why isn\u2019t the Emperor aware of such inefficiency?\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d see things my way. Have fun playing with the kobolds. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\n\nYou leave Pollo\u2019s office where your team is still waiting for you.\n\n\u201cGerald, I regret that you will not be coming with us on this mission. The Captain wants you to stay with him.\u201d You say.\n\u201cWhat?! But I\u2019m ready to fight!\u201d he protests.\n\u201cThere will be other missions, I promise you. We will prove ourselves so well on this one, that they will have no choice but to send us out on a regular basis. However, your orders are clear in this matter, you are to remain here with Captain Pollo.\u201d\n\u201cB\u2026yes sir.\u201d\n\nJust before Gerald goes into the captain\u2019s office, you whisper into his ear.\n\n\u201cAccidents happen.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a little puzzled by this comment, but you and the rest of your team proceed to your assignment and nobody says anything more about it.\n\nWhen you finally get to the town, it\u2019s a sorry sight. A lot of the buildings are damaged and the streets are filled with debris. There are a few people attempting to clean up the place, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re all very demoralized.\n\n\u2018Oh, I see the Empire has finally decided to help us; well you\u2019re too late! The kobolds raided this town last night and as you can see completely trashed the place!\u201d says a disheveled man.\n\u201cThe Empire has many places it has to protect citizen. It is regrettable that your town was attacked, but we are here now to eliminate the problem.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now? Where the fuck were you last night when my wife was killed by those ugly little bastards?\u201d the man says getting in your face.\n\u201cCalm yourself citizen, this will not help your situation.\u201d\n\u201cMy situation? I just said my wife is fucking DEAD! I don\u2019t give a shit about my situation anymore you fucking Empire dickhead! Fuck you and your fucking Emperor!\u201d\n\nIt is at this point the man unwisely pushes your chest with his hand and you instantly grab it and break his whole arm. He predictably crumples in excruciating pain, screaming as the bone juts out of the skin and blood runs out of his body into the mud. All the other towns people who have seen this back off or hide, as they are rightfully worried about what you\u2019re going to do next.\n\n\u201cNow listen up citizens of Dalt! I understand that you\u2019ve all been through a lot, but that is not a reason to give in to insolence! You are all Empire subjects and you will show proper respect or what\u2019s left of this town will suffer in such a manner that you\u2019ll think what the kobolds did was a birthday party.\u201d\n\nThe man whose arm you broke begins to scream more obscenities at you in between his regular howls of pain. You look at Kane and nod. Kane finishes the man off by quickly decapitating him. You take his head and throw it before one of the crowd of peasants who look on in horror.\n\n\u201cRemember this.\u201d You say.\n\nYou remain in the town of Dalt for the night and get rooms from an overly cooperative innkeeper. He also tells you a little information about the kobolds such what direction they came from, what sort of equipment they were using and how many there were during the attack. Before getting some rest you spend a little of the time discussing strategy with your team. You all don\u2019t show it too much, but you are all a little excited about tomorrow.\n\nThe next day you set off towards the wooded hills, it doesn\u2019t take long before you see a kobold patrol wandering around. They look exactly like how you\u2019ve seen them in books, sort of like scaly goblins, but from what you\u2019ve heard, a lot more cunning.\n\nYour team attempts to be stealthy, but perhaps it\u2019s due to the excitement of this first \u201creal\u201d battle. Edgar isn\u2019t as silent as he should be and clumsily steps on a few twigs alerting the patrols.\n\nThe kobold patrol sees all of you, yell excitedly in their language and run away. Edgar is about to chase them, but you knock him to the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he says wondering why you stopped him.\n\u201cTrap, Edgar. Look.\u201d You say and point to a tripwire that would\u2019ve triggered a spiked log that he almost stepped on.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He says.\n\u201cYou were trained better than that Edgar and we went over this last night! This area is probably going to be filled with traps. Now come on, we don\u2019t have the luxury of a surprise attack any more.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of this attack is a tedious exercise in cautiousness broken up by quick battles. The kobolds really have set up traps everywhere and take full advantage of your team\u2019s slow movement to launch periodic ambushes themselves. Fortunately they are very poor warriors even in large numbers and you easily dispatch them. All your fighting eventually leads to a cave, which you sort of figured it would. You warn your team that this place is probably going to be a maze and heavily trapped as well.\n\n\u201cShould we split up so we can cover more ground?\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re going to be neck deep in them when we go into that cave. They may be poor warriors, but even enough of them could overwhelm one or two of us. If we stick together we\u2019ll be fine. Besides, we\u2019re going to be here awhile anyway.\u201d\n\nThere \u201cawhile\u201d isn\u2019t an exaggeration. You spend the remainder of the day and night killing kobolds. Your team seems to enjoy it, but you eventually start to get bored of the monotony. You don\u2019t even bat an eye when you come across what seems to be a breeding chamber and you exterminate all the female kobolds and their young. Eventually you reach a large cave clearing where you meet the leader.\n\n\u201cSssss! Defilersss! Murderersss!\u201d a slightly larger kobold hisses at you from some sort of primitive throne and then orders his guards to attack. It\u2019s rather pathetic, as they fare no better than the rest. A few quick sword and axe blows and this kobold chieftain is alone.\n\nWhile the rest of your team is eager to kill him like the rest, you have a slightly better idea for him. You engage him in singles combat, which is over pretty quickly. You then subdue him with some rope you have in your pack.\n\n\u201cWhy are we taking him as prisoner? We\u2019re Eternals! We don\u2019t take prisoners!\u201d Edgar shouts.\n\u201cYeah, we also aren\u2019t supposed to miss obviously placed traps either, so there\u2019s a first time for everything. Besides I\u2019ve got a good idea for this one.\u201d\n\nYou drag the kobold leader back to town who curses you the whole time in a mixture of his language and yours. When you arrive it is now dawn and the townspeople are surprised to see you back, let alone with a kobold in tow.\n\nYou tie the kobold leader to a tree near the center of the town and address everyone.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Dalt! The kobold nest has been completely destroyed. This\u2026thing was the leader of this particular nest and most likely orchestrated the raid; do with him as you will. There of course are other kobold nests in this province, but the Eternals will be taking care of this long overdue problem. All the Empire needs in this matter is your continued obedience and loyalty.\u201d\n\nAfter giving this speech you and your team take your leave and hear the screams of the kobold leader as the villagers torture and rip him apart.\n\nWhen you arrive back at Fort Glory, other soldiers are surprised to see all of you back alive. It was assumed that at best, half of you would be dead. There is a possible thought of whether you actually succeeded and didn\u2019t just come back in failure, but given that Kane took it upon himself to take \u201ctrophies\u201d his gruesome necklace of kobold ears makes it pretty clear that the job was done.\n\nWhen you report however, it seems the fort has undergone a change in leadership\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Lieutenant Anu and now in charge of Fort Glory until further notice. First things first, did you accomplish your mission?\n\u201cMission accomplished, we killed them all lieutenant. All of their warriors, all of their women, all of their babies, pets, their leader, all of them.\u201d\n\u201cWell always helps to be sure. Which brings me to the next point. Your man Gerald is currently in the stockade. In fact he may be facing execution.\u201d\n\u201cMight I inquire why, sir?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019d probably know as much about it as I do, but if I had to guess? Captain pervert put the moves on him and your man took exception to it and killed him. He claims it was an accident, but there\u2019s no way the captain twisted his own head ALL THE WAY AROUND just by tripping and falling over.\u201d\n\u201cIf Gerald says it was an accident, then I believe him sir.\u201d\n\u201cOkay look, I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that the captain wasn\u2019t complete scum. I should know I had to serve along side him for the past five years. I saw how he\u2019d have teenage boys brought to his office. Now I know you guys are these Eternals that we\u2019ve all heard about, but dammit man, we can\u2019t just have murders within the ranks, we have to respect some sort of order here!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about respecting order sir\u2026I suppose if it is absolutely necessary to execute Gerald, then that will be regrettable. I would however say that Gerald\u2019s actions actually contributed to more order here and will better for the Empire in general.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThe removal of captain Pollo, has allowed you to move up in rank and judging by your feelings on this matter you are a person who respects military decorum. I have no doubt, the fort will be run more efficiently now.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Anu chuckles a bit. \u201cI\u2019d almost think you were trying to butter me up to save your guy, but I already know you genuinely believe what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019re right anyway. (Sigh) Well\u2026I suppose accidents do happen. Nobody here is going to miss Pollo, so I\u2019ll have Gerald released and write up a report.\u201d\n\u201cSir, can I make a request?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re pushing your luck?\u201d\n\u201cNot my intention sir, but I was going to ask if there\u2019s anything my group could do here that\u2019s a little more challenging than killing kobolds?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, yes I imagine you would feel that way...well on the furthest southern edge of the province there have been bands of nomadic raiders and there have been rumors of them organizing under some sort of shaman. Dunno if it\u2019s true or not. Of course we could also transfer you someplace where the battle is a little more suited to your violence level.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Request transfer", "result": "You don\u2019t see much point in staying in this place anymore, you would most likely serve the Empire better elsewhere. Captain Anu grants the request, though he mentions he knows that a Mr. Mol is taking interest in your progress here, so it\u2019ll have to go through him first.\n\nA couple days pass and it is all straightened out. Mr. Mol approves, but he goes with his original plan of separating you all. Brenda and Gerald remain in the Nalin province, Roldan and Warrick go to the Felkan border. You, Kane and Edgar all wind up at the Rask frontier, specifically Fort Defiance. The split is a little odd for all of you, considering you\u2019ve all been together so long.\n\nYou say your goodbyes to Brenda and Gerald first when the caravan comes for you. Next you say your goodbyes to Warrick and Roldan when they make their stop. The remainder of the trip is in relative silence, though sometimes Edgar remarks about how he can\u2019t wait to display his true combat skills against better challenges.\n\nEventually you arrive at the Rask frontier and make your stop at Fort Defiance. You haven\u2019t gotten off the caravan five minutes when a man wearing battle armor approaches you.\n\n\u201cHey are you the Eternals?\u201d\n\u201cYes we are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Captain Ian, I\u2019ve heard about you and while you don\u2019t look like much, we\u2019ll take anyone at this point. Though I would\u2019ve preferred more battle mages or even orcs at this point.\n\nCaptain Ian begins to give you a run down on the entire area. He mentions that the mortality rate here is high so morale isn\u2019t the best. He goes on to mention that Shadow Guard detachments have been assigned here to help out, but between the ogres and the giants there\u2019s only so much that even they can do. He mentions since you three have already worked together he\u2019s just going to leave you together, but will be assigning you to a new unit where you will have others to command as well.\n\nWith the caravan leaving, the three of you head to your new unit. When you see them, quite a few of them are predictably much older than you, but surprisingly you see that half of them are around your age.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re those Eternals huh?\u201d one the older soldiers says almost dismissively.\n\u201cYes? Did you need something corporal?\u201d you say sensing the hostility.\n\u201cNothing, sergeant. I just wondered if you were.\u201d He says backing down from confrontation.\n\nThe three of you settle in as you begin your assignment at Fort Defiance.\n\nYear 18\n\n\u201cKane watch out!\u201d you shout as the wind whips around you and the snowfall nearly blinds your vision.\n\nYou can just make out the figure, which you know to be Kane roll out of the way of a club strike from an ogre attempting to attack him from behind.\n\nYou look around and see the bloody dead bodies of several members of your team and the ogres that ambushed you. You knew that patrolling the Kragen Pass during a blizzard was a stupid idea, but Captain Ian insisted that you had to go and do it. It\u2019s no wonder progress hasn\u2019t been made up here with the captain making inept decisions at every turn. He\u2019s not like Captain Pollo, but he\u2019s not much better. You are starting to seriously wonder about how the Empire keeps allowing such incompetence to pass through.\n\nYou run as fast as you can in the snow to help Kane battle the last two ogres. You cleave at the legs of one of the large monsters causing him to fall into the snow then finish him off with another strike through his head. Kane dispatches his own ogre opponent and the battle is finally over.\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re the only two left again.\u201d Kane says.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting used to that scenario. Come on, let\u2019s head back. This blizzard isn\u2019t letting up and we\u2019ve done all we can here.\u201d\n\nYou and Kane leave behind the bodies and make your way through the blizzard in silence. It\u2019s times like this you half expect Edgar to start going on about how well he did in battle, of course he hasn\u2019t done that ever since you lost him in that battle against some giants last year. You never exactly approved of his reckless ways and it\u2019s ultimately what got him killed, but you still miss him sometimes.\n\nYou are almost at the end of the pass when a large rumbling is heard. You look overhead and even in this blizzard you can see the large figures looming on the cliffs and it\u2019s what you originally were concerned about when you had to patrol this path.\n\n\u201cGIANTS! RUN!\u201d you yell and the pair of you attempt to make it out of the pass. Large boulders crash down along side the cliffs with an equally large amount of ice and snow. Kane runs faster and makes it ahead of you, but this only results in you seeing him crushed completely by a falling boulder. You are engulfed in snow and swept up and buried in the stuff. You\u2019re disorientated, tired, freezing and slowly suffocating, but with determination, you manage to dig yourself out.\n\nUnfortunately several giants face you when you do dig yourself out. You\u2019re out numbered and trapped in the pass. You know that this is most likely going to be your last battle.\n\nYou draw your sword and walk towards the giants. It will be a good death, but your only regret is that you will not survive to serve the Empire for longer than you would\u2019ve liked.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Refuse to leave him behind", "result": "You decide that it might be wise to maintain a presence here, after all there is still work to be done and you\u2019re confident that things will be better at the fort now. Lieutenant Anu nods and says you can set out in a couple days to the town of Jekka. He mentions that the nomads have never been a problem like the kobold are, but lately they have been reaching that level. He also says they aren\u2019t native to Nalin, but rather the desert land south of it.\n\nYou spend the next couple of days at the fort are spent honing your weapon skills and telling your team to do likewise. Gerald joins you after being released from the stockade. He looks a little embarrassed and you reprimand him for his lack of finesse, but welcome him back.\n\nEventually you set off for the southern Nalin border. The journey isn\u2019t as uneventful as the first mission and you encounter a few kobolds attacking travelers along the roads. You easily dispatch them of course.\n\nThe town of Jekka is in much better shape than Dalt, but its obvious the people here have been suffering from attacks.\n\n\u201cEmpire soldiers? Here? I thought you lot were chasing down kobolds to waste time with the likes of us.\u201d A man says to you. He looks to be some sort of town sheriff.\n\u201cAll Empire towns are under our protection citizen. We have heard this one is suffering heavy raids from the desert nomads.\u201d\n\u201c Well, we\u2019ve been doing okay so far, but a few of the other border villages have gotten it pretty bad. One of them was totally destroyed. Those lizard riders have never been this bad or numerous before. The weird thing is, they just destroy and kill, they don\u2019t actually do any proper raiding or looting, not that it really matters. but for the past few months.\u201d\n\u201cWe heard rumors of a shaman uniting them.\u201d\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s the rumor, but really nobody knows what\u2019s going on with them. They make quick attacks and then run back to their accursed desert. So when are more Empire soldiers coming?\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! We\u2019ve been holding out for months with no hope in sight and now that you give us a little bit, you take it away again?\u201d\n\u201cCitizen, I advise you to calm yourself.\u201d You warn, wondering if you\u2019re going to have to make another point like you did in Dalt. You don\u2019t since thought since the sheriff has more sense.\n\u201cAlright, alright, but I\u2019m telling you there are a lot of those lizard riders! I hope you\u2019re more than just regular Empire soldiers. You guys Shadow Guard or something?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re Eternals.\u201d\n\nYou set up your staging point in Jekka. The desert raiders will probably attack this town again as usual, so you might as well take advantage of the fact. The waiting is tedious, but eventually after few days it pays off.\n\nSeveral of the raiders appear in the distance and make no hesitation in their attack. The raiders are trying to rely on intimidation, because they sure aren\u2019t relying on strategy and only attack the town from one direction. The lizard creatures that the raiders ride might be intimidating to the average citizen, but you\u2019ve fought bigger creatures during training. They\u2019re rather clumsy beasts actually and when you and your team begin to use your own hit and run tactics, they start to collide into each other causing problems for the raiders.\n\nAs for the raiders themselves, they prove to be barely better fighters than the kobolds after dismounting several of them. Underneath the desert protection gear they wear, they don\u2019t appear to be human or any other race you\u2019re familiar with, but they bleed just like all them and that\u2019s the important thing.\n\nAs many battles often go, this one is over quicker than it felt. The remaining raiders run off and you order your people to mount up and chase them down which is fairly easy to do.\n\nJekka suffered some damage and a few dead, but overall the townspeople couldn\u2019t be happier with the outcome and most shower you with praise. However, you get the impression that you\u2019re going to be facing more of these raiders in the near future and you\u2019re right.\n\nA couple days pass and another raid on the town of Jekka occurs in the same exact manner, then again a few days after that. A week passes and there are no more raids, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve stopped. You already know they\u2019ve been attacking several settlements, so you tell Warrick and Roldan to scout out the closest ones to see what their situation is while you try to build some proper defenses for Jekka.\n\nA week passes and you learn more about your foes from a villager who survived the destruction of his home. The desert raiders (or the Usksha as you\u2019ve come to find out their proper name) have indeed been united under one banner by a shaman of some sort. The villager says he saw this being with his own eyes and was spared for the sole purpose to warn all that the Usksha will no longer tolerate a foreign presence encroaching on their desert. This shaman said he has been chosen personally by their god Usk to destroy all those that do and that the town of Jekka will not be able to resist the inevitable destiny that it will fall.\n\n\u201cSo, he\u2019s coming here then? Good, saves us the trouble of hunting him down.\u201d You reply.\n\u201cCombined with this information and based on what Warrick and I have scouted out, it sounds like there will be even more of them. Possibly a full blown army. We might need reinforcements from Fort Glory.\u201d Roldan says.\n\u201cReinforcements? Hah! We\u2019ve beaten them several times with ease!\u201d\n\u201cWould they even get here in time? We don\u2019t exactly know when the attack will come.\u201d Brenda asks.\n\u201cThey might or they might not, still we should try. Find out who the best runner is in this town and have them travel to Fort Glory with this news. We can continue to prepare in the meantime.\u201d You say.\n\nThe next morning several Uskshas appear in the distance like the other times you fought them. Then more show up, then even more. The town sheriff completely panics and says he\u2019s never seen this many before. This of course causes most of the other townies to panic as well. You slap him and tell him if he and anyone else aren\u2019t going to be helpful then they need to stay out of the way and find someplace to hide.\n\nThey come at you screaming and yelling in their barbarian language and suddenly a huge worm thing comes out of the ground in the center of town.\n\n\u201cHa ha! At last a real fight!\u201d Edgar yells and runs at it immediately as it destroys the nearby tavern. You order Kane to come with you to help Edgar while the rest try to delay the rest of the usksha. You just hope the barricades hold up long enough for them to greatly whittle the numbers down.\n\nYou, Edgar and Kane approach the great worm, which bashes its great body into the side of another building, killing many townspeople hiding inside.\n\n\u201cYOU! You think you can destroy me? I am an avatar of Usk! How can you destroy a god when you are, but a mere child of a corrupt empire?\u201d you suddenly hear in your mind.\n\nIt takes a split moment, but you realize that this beast is the shaman. He has used magic of some kind to transform himself into this thing. It doesn\u2019t matter how much favor he has from his god though, he isn\u2019t one and will die like the rest.\n\nUsing his daggers like climbing gear, Kane jumps as high as he can and sink them into the shaman, while you and Edgar attempt to chop at his body like it was a tree. The shaman roars and attempts to smash you with his body, but you pull Edgar out of the way and Kane jumps off before being crushed. The shaman burrows back into the hole he came from and a few moments later he breaks through in another area of the town and begins destroying the barricades. You reach the shaman just in time for him to sink back into his hole again, while usksha pour in through the broken wall.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d Edgar shouts in exasperation.\n\u201cPlug up that opening with their dead bodies!\u201d you shout as you chop off the head of one their lizards before doing the same to the fallen rider.\n\nHolding the back the tide of usksha isn\u2019t exactly what you want to be doing though, you want to take down that shaman, do that and this battle is over.\n\nWhen you hear him break through the ground again elsewhere in town, you tell Kane and Edgar to hold the line here, while you go see if you can get him.\n\nYou see him near the center of town again trying to finish destroying the buildings there. You chop down a few usksha near him and resume attempting to bring him down. He uses his crushing attack like last time, but this time you anticipate and not only dodge, but you manage to run your sword into his eye when his head is at your level. He bellows in pain and attempts to escape again, but you won\u2019t let go of your sword and pull it towards you as he pulls backwards. You fall to the ground as the sword finishes slicing through the shaman\u2019s flesh leaving a gapping wound where his eye and part of his \u201cface\u201d would be.\n\nYou then see the worm collapse to the ground and begin to glow. Some of the others nearby, human and usksha alike stop fighting to stand and watch in wonder. The shaman transforms back into his natural form, his head and body displaying heavy wounds.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026can\u2019t\u2026you\u2026why\u2026we hate you\u2026you aren\u2019t\u2026wanted\u2026your empire will die\u2026we will reclaim what is oursss\u2026\u201d are the scattered words you hear in your head as you approach the shaman\u2019s broken body.\n\u201cStop talking.\u201d You say and run your sword through his other eye.\n\nIt is at this point you hear the howls of several usksha as their mental link with their leader has been severed. You, your team and even a few vengeful townspeople butcher the remaining usksha that don\u2019t get away while attempting to retreat.\n\nJekka is half in ruins and many are dead, but the battle has been won.\n\nThe following day a detachment of troops arrive from Fort Glory. They look at the carnage and the platoon leader reports to you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Corporal Delan and I\u2019m here to help you with\u2026shit, what the hell happened here?\u201d\n\u201cVictory, corporal. Victory.\u201d You say.\n\u201cSo\u2026the threat is gone?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gone, but it won\u2019t be rearing its head for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cI say we should march into that desert and wipe them out permanently, then we\u2019d never have to worry about them ever again!\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cWell, if you decide to do that, we\u2019ll help. I know you\u2019ve been busy down here so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but we\u2019ve made great strides in eliminating the kobolds, so Captian Anu told us to help you with this problem as much as we can.", "action_results": [{"action": "March into the desert", "result": "The usksha are broken and on the run, the opportunity to eliminate them as a future threat is certainly there, along with extending the Empire\u2019s influence south of the Nalin province.

Look I know you guys are Eternals, and I won\u2019t deny that you\u2019re the best warriors I\u2019ve ever seen, but even you won\u2019t be able to conquer the usksha in their desert! They\u2019ve lived there for centuries, even before the Empire existed! They know it like nobody else, you\u2019ll be outnumbered and fighting the elements themselves!\u201d the Jekka sheriff exclaims. Somehow he survived the battle by hiding no doubt.\n\nPerhaps he is content on being a coward all his life, but you were meant for much more! You are an Eternal and the Emperor himself will reward you himself when you make the first steps in civilizing the desert. You slap him again and tell him that you\u2019ll need as much water as everyone can carry.\n\nAfter a period of rest, you, your team and Delan\u2019s men set off for the desert. You figure the best way to approach this is to follow the usksha\u2019s tracks. This works out well at first as the lizard mounts are heavy footed creatures that leave deep prints, so you come across several small bands of fleeing usksha.\n\nWhen you begin to leave the Nalin province and enter the desert, the prints get harder to track. You follow tracks for two days before you find more usksha. Still, you aren\u2019t finding any large settlements.\n\nBy day four and Delan\u2019s men are starting to complain. He tries to maintain order, but it\u2019s obvious they can\u2019t take the heat of the day and cold of the night. Your own team is fairing better, but even a couple of them are starting to make comments.\n\nOn the seventh night, you\u2019re ambushed by several usksha who spring up from the sands itself; they manage to kill several of Delan\u2019s men before you dispatch them.\n\n\u201cSergeant, I think we need to get the hell out of this desert. There\u2019s nothing here, but sand and death!\u201d\n\u201cThen leave weakling! We\u2019re more than able to carry out this mission ourselves! We don\u2019t need anybody! We\u2019re Eternals!\u201d Edgar shouts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt our abilities sir, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder if this isn\u2019t a waste of time. We\u2019ve defeated the usksha and chased them deep into their own land. Maybe we\u2019ve made our point.\u201d Roldan says.\n\u201cI\u2019m finding myself agreeing sir, we could better serve the Empire elsewhere.\u201d Gerald adds.\n\n\u201cDuly noted. We\u2019re sticking with the original plan and as for you Delan, you\u2019re under my command too, so you aren\u2019t going anywhere either, now I advise you to find your guts and keep what men you have left in line, before I take away what little authority you still have left.\u201d\n\nCorporal Delan obeys and silently slinks back to his men. Your own people obey as well, but you know that the voices of dissent are already there. Still, you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019ll find something of importance out here along with wiping out usksha.\n\nOn day ten, a strange reptilian creature attacks you. The first instinct is to defend yourself of course, but when it turns Warrick and Gerald to stone instantly, even you find yourself worried.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at it! It\u2019s got some sort of magic attack!\u201d you shout and put your shield to cover yourself.\n\nDelan and his couple remaining men don\u2019t even stick around they turn and run completely. Edgar closes his eyes and swings wildly at the beast, but only manages to get himself mauled by the creature\u2019s sharp teeth and claws. The distraction is enough for Brenda to shoot several arrows in the beast while its back is to her. The beast gives a final bellow and dies.\n\nYou survey the damage and it\u2019s pretty bad. You\u2019ve lost two men, and looking at Edgar on the ground it\u2019ll soon be three. He can\u2019t even form any words, he just looks up at the sky gurgling and spitting up blood and trying to clutch at an arm which is no longer there.\n\n\u201cI told you! I told you we should\u2019ve gone back!\u201d Roldan screams.\n\u201cSilence! I\u2019m in charge here and you won\u2019t speak to me like that again!\u201d you say.\n\u201cSomebody needs to tell you something, because\u2026\u201d\n\nYou lose your patience from a combination of the disrespect, the loss, the failure, the heat, all of it. You punch Roldan causing him to fall to the ground. He looks up in disbelief at first, but then begins to laugh.\n\n\u201cHa ha\u2026ha ha ha ha ha! We\u2026ha ha ha! Found more usksha!\u201d he laughs and points. You all turn to see a sizable group of mounted usksha in the distance. They don\u2019t move in either, instead they shoot at you with their bows.\n\nBrenda catches an arrow to her leg before you can sound a retreat. You and Kane run, but Roldan just sits there still laughing, the next time you turn your head to look back, he\u2019s no longer sitting up. Brenda tries to keep up, but the arrow in her leg slows her down and eventually she catches two more arrows in her back, killing her much in the same way she killed that strange beast.\n\nEventually you and Kane get away, but in all the excitement you don\u2019t know where you are and you don\u2019t even have the tracks you were following to go back to. Under better and less stressful conditions you might get your bearings again, but you never do.\n\nYour next few days involve wandering the desert being continually worn down by usksha ambushes and the sun. You leave Kane\u2019s dehydrated body and continue alone, but not for long as you eventually also succumb to the heat.\n\nAs you lay dying your thoughts of glory are gone and though dehydrated, you manage to shed a single tear for your failure to serve the Emperor.", "action_results": []}]}, null, null]}, null]}, {"action": "Die", "result": "Despite your desire to go on an official mission, you feel that it would be worse to leave one of your team members behind, especially what would lie in store for him.\n\n\u201cI will not leave a member of my team behind.

You\u2019re on clean up detail until further notice. That will be all.\u201d Pollo says in a perturbed tone.\n\nYou leave Captain Pollo\u2019s office with the bad news to your team.\n\n\u201cWHAT?! I was ready for a fight!\u201d Edgar yells.\n\u201cWhat happened in there?\u201d Roldan asks.\n\u201cYeah, we were going on a proper mission and not we aren\u2019t!\u201d Gerald adds completely oblivious that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere to begin with.\n\u201cLook, there will be other times, let\u2019s not dwell on it, we\u2019ve got toilets to clean\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of your team follows your lead and grumble a bit, but Edgar is doing the most of it. By the end of the day you\u2019ve cleaned up a lot of the fort, but really, this isn\u2019t what you want to be doing.\n\nThe next day, Captain Pollo feels that you\u2019ve done such a good job that he says that your talents would be wasted in battle. He feels that other more experienced soldiers can now be freed up from such trivial duties that your team is performing. You\u2019re kept at the fort doing all sorts of menial labor.\n\nDay pass into months and the mocking never stops from the other soldiers in the fort who call you the \u201cmop kids\u201d. This angers all of you, but of course once again Edgar is the one that nearly comes to blows with other soldiers. You have to stop him several times. Eventually his anger is directed towards you.\n\n\u201cFuck! This shit is all your fault anyway! What the hell did you do to piss off Captain Pollo all those months ago?\u201d\n\u201cNevermind Edgar! And you\u2019re out of line, I am your leader!\u201d\n\u201cHah! Some great job you got us fearless leader! We\u2019re making the Empire safe from filthy shitholes and dirty floors!\u201d Edgar says getting in your face.\n\nBefore the others can break it up, you grab Edgar and slam him up against the wall.\n\n\u201cYou wanna know what I did? I refused to leave Gerald behind to get fucked by that sick dipshit captain!\u201d you shout in his face.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Edgar says.\n\u201cHe\u2026he wanted to fuck me?!\u201d Gerald says in disbelief\n\u201cWell it was pretty obvious when we first met him, Gerald.\u201d Brenda remarks.\n\u201cSurprised he didn\u2019t just order you to leave him, or more logically order Gerald himself.\u201d Roldan adds.\n\nYou let go of Edgar.\n\n\u201cI dunno, I think he\u2019s playing some sort of game. Maybe it\u2019s a test even. Like if I\u2019m willing to leave a man behind or not.\u201d You answer.\n\u201cWell I sure wish you had sergeant, because that would\u2019ve been the smart thing to do! So what if Gerald would\u2019ve had to please the captain? It\u2019s not like it would\u2019ve been a big deal. The greater good of the team and the Empire would\u2019ve been better served with the rest of us chopping up some kobolds, not mopping floors and cleaning!\u201d Edgar says unsympathetically.\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Gerald replies.\n\u201cRight, Edgar, I\u2019ll remember your speech the next time some sicko wants me to leave you behind instead.\u201d\n\u201cLook all I\u2019m saying, is you gotta make tough decisions like that if you want to be a real leader! Just think if we were on a mission and you had to leave Gerald or any of us behind to die, to complete it? You would\u2019ve probably froze up and got us all killed. I\u2019m not sure if I believe in you as our leader if you can\u2019t make simple choices\u2026\u201d\n\nBetween the monotonous cleaning, the mocking, Edgar\u2019s bitching and your own doubt about your leadership abilities, you can\u2019t take it anymore. You punch Edgar in the face mid-sentence and knock him to the floor, he\u2019s dazed for a moment, but doesn\u2019t hesitate to attack you right back.\n\nThe pair of you are going at it which draws the attention of several passing soldiers, who take the time to mock you. This is a mistake on their part as you and Edgar are in a heightened state of anger causing you both to attack them instead. This then escalates into others aiding them, which in turn causes your team to aid you as well.\n\nThe brawl is chaotic and counter productive, but for a brief moment you actually feel \u201calive\u201d again. You imagine most of your fellow Eternals do too after all this is the first \u201cbattle\u201d they\u2019ve had in months. Unfortunately Kane feels so alive, he forgets that he\u2019s fighting fellow Empire soldiers and ends up killing three of them.\n\nThe brawl ends with the opposing soldiers running and the rest of you standing around looking at Kane who doesn\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t celebrating your victory.\n\nWhen this is brought to the attention of Captain Pollo he\u2019s furious and has you all put in the stockade and mentions that a trial will be held tomorrow to decide what to do with you. He already doesn\u2019t like you, so you\u2019re guessing it\u2019s just going to be for show and then he\u2019ll do whatever he likes anyway.\n\n\u201cLook, Kane is the one who killed them, he should be the one to take the fall!\u201d Edgar points out.\n\u201cFor the greater good of the team huh, Edgar?\u201d Warrick replies.\n\u201cDamn right! Look you know I\u2019m right! If we try to fight this, the captain is just going to punish all of us!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to punish us all anyway Edgar!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re probably right, but Kane here is the only one who\u2019ll get the noose. I mean no offense Kane, but come on even you know I\u2019m right on this!\u201d\n\nAs much as you\u2019d like to punch out Edgar again, that\u2019s what lead to this in the first place. Actually if you had just left behind Gerald, this could\u2019ve all been avoided. Maybe Edgar\u2019s right, the good of the many outweighing the needs of the few. You were taught that before in training, you don\u2019t know why you questioning it now.\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t feel right just throwing Kane to the wolves, just like it didn\u2019t feel right leaving Gerald behind.", "action_results": [{"action": "Defend Kane", "result": "You\u2019re a team and you were trained together as one. You feel that you should do everything you can to protect one of your own, especially in this sort of situation. Besides, Captain Pollo is most likely going to punish you all anyway. You might well stand for what you believe in.\n\nEdgar naturally disagrees with you again, but grudgingly goes along with it since he doesn\u2019t want to be on the receiving end of another one of your beatings. Everyone else agrees more readily. Kane while appreciative seems to be oddly detached from the situation, almost as if he doesn\u2019t care.\n\nThe next day all of you are marched into the cafeteria, which is serving as a makeshift court room. Many of the other soldiers are calling for your blood, but some of them are just sitting quietly. Captain Pollo asks both sides what exactly happened, and despite the other side making themselves look more sympathetic, fact remains Kane DID kill three of them. There really isn\u2019t any way to defend against it. You attempt to direct blame to the other soldiers and claim it was an accident, but nothing works.\n\nCaptain Pollo decides that all of you are at fault and says you\u2019re all going to be executed for treason. It is at that point to make one last plea.\n\n\u201cCaptain! I beg you not to carry out this sentence! At least not on my team! I was the leader. I was the one who should\u2019ve kept a better handle on them. This incident is my fault. If you have to execute someone, execute me, but not for treason, for incompetence in the service of the Empire. I may have failed to serve the Emperor, but the rest of my team may still make up for this terrible mistake that is mainly my fault.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an impassioned plea. Even the soldiers that were cheering for your sentence are silent. Captain Pollo thinks for a moment and readdresses you.\n\n\u201cVery well. I suppose you have a point. However Kane still killed three men, his crime can\u2019t go unpunished. He will still be executed for murder and treason. The rest of your team members will be freed, but I\u2019m having them all separated and transferred to other places. I can\u2019t take the chance of having another incident like this happening again. Maybe the Rask frontier would be a better place for them since they want to fight so much. Execution will take place tomorrow morning.

It doesn\u2019t make sense based on your training. Mistress beat duty and obedience into you, yet you rejected Captain Pollo\u2019s initial request. Gruz certainly thought you were leadership material. He was obviously was wrong. A lot of questions go through your mind, but ultimately you realize it\u2019s futile. You\u2019re to be executed at morning and it\u2019ll hardly matter what reason you had for any of your actions. You eventually fall asleep.\n\nThe next morning, you and Kane are taken from your cells and marched to the gallows. The pair of you say nothing the entire time until the hangman puts the noose around your neck and you are asked if you have any last words.\n\nKane continues to remain silent.

You remember when Mistress first put you against him you were slightly afraid of him, though you learned that day that size does not always equal skill. Still, he has certainly improved since those times otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be here. From other observations you\u2019ve made, he is one of the more talkative members of your team, and tends to get along with everyone.\n\nWarrick is a brown skinned youth with very curly hair. He tends to be more serious minded than some of the others, but can be talkative when he wants to be. Warrick\u2019s fighting abilities were always good, but never anything special. He has proven to be a lot stealthier than the rest of you, but other than that nothing stands out about him.\n\nBrenda is the only female that made it through training, though there weren\u2019t many to begin with. Female Eternals weren\u2019t given any special treatment, so the fact that she is here, means she has definitely proven herself. Her fighting skills are adequate, but it is with ranged weapons like a bow where she really shines. While you all were altered at birth to function slightly differently than a normal human, the biology of a teenager and all that entails still affects all of you on some level. On more than one occasion your fellow male Eternals have begun to look at her a little differently than each other and sometimes you hear discussions about her and her physical attributes (Mostly Edgar and Gerald). It is unknown if she thinks similar things about the rest of you. As always you have attempted to maintain a proper barrier, though even you cannot deny that you\u2019ve let yourself get distracted a few times by her\u2026 green eyes.\n\nRoldan, like Warrick doesn\u2019t stand out in any meaningful way, however he does display a great sense of duty like you do. His combat skills are also about the same as Warrick\u2019s. He tends to try to diffuse disagreements between others in the team when they arise. Almost like a \u201cpeacemaker.\u201d You find this behavior a little strange for an Eternal, but you appreciate his efforts in helping to support a cohesive unit. If you were looking for a second, it would be Roldan. He\u2019s a stable influence on the team.\n\nKane is probably the best warrior in the team besides you. Mistress pitted him against you in your first match as well. After you incapacitated Gerald, Kane nearly beat you, but you managed to pull out a victory. (Much to Mistress\u2019 dismay) Since that first victory, Kane and you have had several sparring sessions. Most of the time you won, but there were times when he did. Every time he did though, he would always ask if you were okay. Outside of these sessions, he has always been very respectful of you. You might even consider him to be your second, but he tends to stay in the back even more than Warrick and takes no initiative on anything unless directly called upon. He barely speaks to anyone, has a rather distant demeanor towards everyone else and he keeps to himself even more than you do. Still, he works well in the team when the time comes and nobody can doubt his combat skills.\n\nEdgar is your \u201cproblem\u201d teammate with fiery red hair and an equally fiery temper. He\u2019s always been a little more emotional than the rest of you though that doesn\u2019t detract from his combat skills, which rank up there with Kane\u2019s though unlike Kane, he\u2019s never beaten you, but oh boy would he like to. Edgar would like to do a lot of things; one of those things is be the leader. He borders on insubordination at times and is probably the most outspoken of the group and will be the first one to point out flaws in something even if he turns out to be wrong (which he usually is). He also is an arrogant braggart that boasts about his abilities or successes whenever they arise. Unsurprisingly, he tends to rub everyone else the wrong way and if there is ever a major disagreement on the team, he\u2019s usually the center of it. However, he can back up most of his boasts and is more than willing to prove himself and is not a coward in any sense of the word. Your own opinion of him is that he would be a much better warrior, and possibly could be a leader if he became more disciplined, a LOT more disciplined. You\u2019re guessing his short stature (only Brenda is shorter) is part of what makes him behave the way he does.", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "The Eternal Program (Hope)", "result": "The Nalin province exists on the southern outskirts of the Empire and is one of the quieter areas of it, one might even call it \u201cbackwards\u201d but that wouldn\u2019t really be a fair assessment.

Odd nomads that ride lizard mounts have been sighted more and more on the edges of the desert and Nalin. There haven\u2019t been many encounters, but the few there have been, have been hostile.
