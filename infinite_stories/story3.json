Get on the phone NOW, or I'm gonna go over there and shove a pipe organ up your ass!\"\n\nThat got his attention.\n\n\"Wolf, I'm sorry, but I fear I'm in a deep depression.\"\n\"What else is new?

Werewolves aren't popular anymore you know\u0085there might be something\u0085here it is! It's called Wolf Pack.\"\n\"Pack? That implies more than one wolf on the set there Erik.

It's a horror comedy about a werewolf family and how they\nadjust to human society. Looks like you'll be playing with a lot of young pups as you'd call them.\"\n\"WHAT?! NO! What the fuck Erik? I'm a fucking monster not something to be fucking laughed at! And they already did a movie like that a long time ago and it sucked!\"\n\"Well that's all I got. Maybe you could talk to the director to make changes since they also wrote it. I'm sure you and her are familiar with each other.

Some of them are in human form, but you can smell them for who they truly are though. These cubs today, you swear they would've never lasted back in the old days. All flash and nothing to back it up. (Though you don't mind looking at the young females that are there) That's why they hang out in packs. You never did that even when you were young. You were always a lone wolf.\n\n\"Hey who's the fossil?\" one of them asks.\n\"Hey Grandpa, the remake of Old Yellow is next door!\"\n\nThis causes a howl of laughter from all of them, until you confront the one who said it. Probably the leader no doubt. Not even in wolf form. Pathetic.\n\n\"I'm going to give you time to transform into a more adequate fighting form before I neuter you.\" You calmly explain.\n\"You? You're like 300 years old! I could take\u0085\"\n\nCan't say you didn't give him a chance.\n\nYou immediately pounce on him, knocking him down while clamping your jaws on his face and digging your fangs in.\n\n\"HOLY SHIT DUDE!\" one of them shouts.\n\"Oh my god he's killing him!\" a female screams.\n\"Get him off of him, get him off of him!\"\n\nWhile them all attempt to pull you off of their leader you hear a familiar voice that gets your attention.\n\n\"Well, I see Erik passed my script over to you, good. I'm also glad to see you're still as anti-social as usual Wolf.\" Mary says as you finally get off of your misguided heckler and approach her. She still looks the same, though she looks a lot better now that she got rid of that hair style she used to have and dyed it blonde.\n\"Just re-establishing the proper hierarchy, nothing more.\"\n\"Hmm, always the Alpha Male, that was what I always loved about you. So primal. Maybe later I can dress in a little red cloak and we can reenact a fairy tale.\"\n\"Some fairy tale, as I remember you loved a lot of beings.\"\n\"Hey I can't help who I am. I was created this way.\"\n\"Just like Frankie eh?\"\n\"Don't you compare me to that sicko! Yes we are controlled by our genetics to a certain degree, but as you damn well know I rose above them! I made my own identity. I'm a successful director and writer now, so what if I have a healthy sexual appetite? There's nothing wrong with that, I'm sure you'd agree given all the beings you had your way with before, after and DURING your marriage!\"\n\"Look never mind all that. I got a real problem with this film.\" You say side stepping her correct accusation.\n\"What's wrong with it?\"\n\"What's wrong with it? Are you kidding me? It sucks! It makes a mockery of werewolves! You even named one of them fucking Benji!\"\n\"Well comedy is popular now. Plus children like monsters just as long as they aren't too scary, so I was hoping to make it a family film.\"\n\"ARRGH! I don't DO family films! This is insulting and demeaning!\"\n\"How? Come on Wolf. In most horror movies you've made you always got killed in the end by a human, how was that any less demeaning?\"\n\"Because at least I was portrayed as feared monster that killed a bunch of people!

I'm more of a golem.\" Mary attempts to correct you.\n\"Who gives a shit, you're still basically a walking corpse, and your flesh is dead. You're Undead in my book.\"\n\"You know for someone who hasn't been able to find a job in months and is basically just rotting away in his little cabin, you'd think that you'd be a little more appreciative.

Erik tried to help you and you don't appreciate any of it! That's why none of your children speak to you and\u0085\"\n\nYou run back over to her and slam her into the wall. You stare at her face to face as she struggles to get free. She's strong, but you manage to keep her pinned. She really pissed you off and you were already pissed off to begin with.\n\n\"Fuck you, and fuck Erik! You two don't know shit about me, never did. I'm through with the pair of you! In fact I think I'll be taking something with me since you're so worried about me being alone\u0085\"\n\nYou release Mary and go over to the wolflings who look a little worried that you're going to cause harm to them. Many of them cast their eyes downward.\n\n\"Hey, you want to be REALLY tough? You want to really raise some hell? Come with me. If you want to stay under the thumb of this patchwork dead bitch and be exploited and mocked, stay here.\n\nYour statement alone convinces all of them. They all follow you, even the one you made an example of. Mary attempts to call everyone back, but it's useless, you've taken control of the pack and they'll do what you want now.\n\nAnd right now you want to get into a fight. You think about all the people and creatures that wronged you in some way and only two of them keep coming to mind consistently.\n\nOne is that fucking Dr. Victor Frankenstein. If it wasn't for him, Frankie and Mary wouldn't have been created in the first place which also means you wouldn't have gotten yourself into trouble all those years ago. You wouldn't have had to put up with his \"children\" taking jobs away from you. Not to mention he sued you once.\n\nBut the one who you REALLY despise, is that bisexual bloodsucker. Fucking Dracula or Vlad, or whatever the hell he's calling himself these days.

No human has ever given you such trouble. You know he's still alive. (Mad scientists always find ways of prolonging their lives somehow) That won't be true for long though, if you get your way. You killed him once before. This time you're going to make sure he stays that way.\n\nHe's probably got whatever crappy inventions and experiments protecting his castle and from what you know, Frankie's still living with his \"Dad\" as well.\n\nYou don't give a fuck, you'll kill him too. You figure you'll be doing the world a favor as well as getting some satisfaction. Besides, you've got to show these wolflings what being a werewolf is all about.\n\n\"All right you cubs! We're going to go raise some fucking hell. We're going to Frankenstein's Castle. We're going to rip the place apart brick by brick, and I'M going to rip Victor apart limb from limb.\"\n\"Erm\u0085Castle Frankenstien? Isn't that where Frankie lives?\" one of the wolflings asks.\n\"I heard he's really powerful, didn't he fight Dracula and win?\"\n'I dunno if we should mess with him.\"\n\nYou can't believe your ears! These snot nosed pups know nothing of their heritage! Back in the old days they would've been killed and eaten for such cowardice!\n\n\"Goddammit are you Wolves or fucking Chihuahuas?

Now are you going to run with me and be a fucking Wolf or are you going to go back home with your tails tucked between your legs?\"\n\nAfter looking at each other for awhile they all agree to go with you.\n\n\"Good! Now I want all of you to transform into your wolf form too! I'm traveling with fellow wolves not humans!\"\n\nJust before one of the females begins to transform, you stop her. She's dressed in a short leather skirt and a tight white t-shirt that's tied in the center and has long flowing brown hair. You can smell that she's in heat. You hate to coin a pun, but she literally is one hot l'il bitch.\n\n\"Erm, not you. You stay in your human form; I kind of like the whole teenage slut look you got going on. In fact you come here right now; you'll be traveling on my bike with me.\" You say.\n\nAs she slides in behind you and holds on, you ask her one more question.\n\n\"So what's your name?\"\n\"Ginger. What's your name, you never did tell us.\"\n\"Wolf. Just Wolf baby. Remember it. You'll be screaming it later.\"\n\nDamn you're so fucking cool, you think as you start up your Harley and ride ahead of the pack.\n\n(You'd probably be even cooler if these pups weren't all riding those Japanese \"crotch rocket\" bikes, but that'll have to be another lesson for another day)\n\nAfter a couple of days of riding, and a few \"pit stops\" with Ginger, you all eventually reach Castle Frankenstein. You park your bikes at the gate, and size the place up, which now looks a lot different. It looks like a damn Nazi fortress now, there's guard towers and everything. It seems Victor has been keeping himself very busy in recent years.\n\nAs it begins to rain, a familiar voice calls to you from one of the towers.\n\n\"Its you. Vic always knew you'd return one day. I never believed him though. I guess I owe him fifty bucks.\"\n\nYou look up and see Igor, he looks different too. He has a lot of clumsy cybernetic implants, one of them being some sort of gun in place of an arm. More of Vic's \"handy work\" no doubt. He's still got that damn hump on his back though.\n\n\"Igor? You still alive? I thought your ungrateful master would've just let you die of old age and get himself another assistant. I see he did a real good job of improving you though. Tell me, how's it feel to be the real brains, never getting the credit and continuing to be a doormat?\"\n\"I'm happy with my lot in life. How's it feel to be broke ass overgrown dog who's trying to relive his lost youth?\" Igor retorts back.\n\"Don't know yet.

I'm pretty sure he's firing silver bullets at us.\"\n\"Oh I KNOW he is. Hence the reason why I told everyone to get out of the way. Okay so we're not going through the front gate, the castle's a big place right? Igor's only guarding the front. I say we split up and scale the walls on the sides and around the back. We'll meet up inside the castle.\"\n\"Yeah, but won't there be other defenses?\"\n\"Probably. So you better be fucking prepared! This ain't no damn game. You cubs think you're really tough when in fact you've probably never had a real challenge. This is it. Don't think about backing out now. This is where we truly test the idea of survival of the fittest. Damn, my blood is starting to feel that rush! Don't you all feel it? I haven't felt this way since they sent a group of ten \"werewolf assassins\" to put me down. Shit. They never tried that again! Ha ha ha ha ha!\"\n\nWhile you're reveling in gruesome nostalgia, your pack is looking at you like you've completely lost it. And they're probably right. However, your speech seems to have stirred something in them.\n\n\"The crazy old fossil's right! I remember having to hear about similar stuff my grandfather used to talk about all the damn time. I never really paid any attention to it before. Now I think I understand. We need to prove our skills to truly be proud to call ourselves werewolves!\" one of them states.\n\"Now that's the attitude I'm talking about!\"\n\nYou all huddle in the rain and make a howling noise in unison to the moon and proceed with your plan. You all split up into a couple of groups and begin to scale the side and back walls, which really isn't all that difficult. You know Igor's probably ran off to warn Vic though. All you can think is, he better have something better than just Igor and Frankie defending him.\n\nAs you prowl around in the courtyard, you hear moaning and the clomping of several footsteps. You and your group turn to see some of Vic's defenses.\n\n\"Zombies? Are you fucking kidding me Vic? I thought you'd at least have some robots or something!\" you say to yourself. Though upon a second look, you see that the horde of corpses aren't actually zombies. Zombies are complete corpses brought back to life. These things look more like Frankie, except designed even worse. A lot of them have arms and legs in odd places. Some have a couple of heads or extra limbs. Most aren't even stitched together neatly, there are just giant rivets and spikes sticking out, holding them together. These are probably some of his \"failed\" experiments.\n\nDoesn't matter, they're close enough to be Undead for you.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fight them.", "result": "Damn straight! That's what you're here for!\n\nYou take out the nearest pile of shit with ease and your pack follows suit. They're a little tougher than you thought, but limbs are flying everywhere. Needless to say you're really enjoying yourself, and you can see your pack is too. (Well the ones that haven't gotten themselves killed)\n\nYou attack one large experiment with four arms, it catches a few heavy hits on you, before you rip them off. It's relentless and begins smashing its head (Which contains a lot of jagged metal bits) into you, knocking you down. As you shake it off, Ginger (Who's now in wolf form) and a couple of other wolflings comes to your aid and finish off the large abomination.\n\n\"Godammit! I had that! Don't EVER come to help me! I can handle myself!\" you snarl angrily.\n\"We were just helping\u0085\" Ginger says casting her eyes downward and lowering her ears.\n\n\"\u0085yeah\u0085well\u0085just don't let it happen again\u0085\" you say understanding they weren't really trying to embarrass you. \"Come on, we're done here, let's get in the castle.\"\n\nYou meet up with the ones remaining in your pack at the front door of the castle. You put all your muscle into it and rip the doors of their hinges. When you step inside, you narrowly dodge a laser beam of some sort.\n\n\"He's got the whole place trapped, be careful where you\u0085\"\n\nA wolfling steps on some floor stone that releases yet another beam trap, reducing him to ashes.\n\n\"Step.\" You say completing the sentence.

Assuming you survive long enough to get to me of course!\"\n\nAt this point he does his typical Mad Scientist laugh. If he thinks you're going to waste your time in his castle of death traps he's sadly mistaken. He seems to have forgotten you have an excellent sense of smell and tracking in general.\n\nOf course the smell of dead bodies seems to be emanating everywhere.

It would suck if there wasn't a real battle to fight after all this.\n\nYou burst into the room with strong burning smell and see big globes of energy, conduits, generators and a big ass corpse with cybernetic implants lying on the table. It's Frankie with some modifications and absorbing more electricity than lightning rod.\n\nYou half expect to see Victor somewhere, but all you hear is the loudspeaker disturbing your ears again.\n\n\"You see Wolf!

Look I showed you what it means to truly be a Wolf tonight. It's up to you to do something with it.\"\n\nGinger kneels down and tries to sit you up hoping that you're not really dying. She's very upset.\n\n\"You can't die! I want you with me\u0085I\u0085\"\n\"Stop Ginger. Don't say it. Don't give yourself anymore unnecessary pain, especially when I don't deserve it. It's just as well as I die now, I probably would've only broken your heart later. Just remember me how I was in the short time you knew me and every time you look at your litter.\"\n\nYou touch her stomach.\n\n\"How do you know? I mean it's too early, we can't be sure if\u0085\" Ginger exclaims.\n\"Please. I'm the Alpha Wolf. I never fucking miss. I got kids everywhere. None of them ever listened to me or talk to me, but I got 'em.\"\n\"What do you want me to tell our litter about you?\"\n\"Whatever you want, you'll be the one raising them and I'll be too dead to do anything about it\u0085 just teach them what I taught all of you here tonight\u0085hopefully they'll listen. Damn willful pups\u0085mmm\u0085getting sleepy\u0085one more thing\u0085\"\n\"What's that Wolf?\"\n\"Burn my damn body, I don't want some fucker trying to bring me back to life! I hate the Undead!\"\n\nYou close your eyes and feel the darkness envelop you.\n\nAfter a brief period of howling, the remaining pack members take your body and burn it just like you asked, then they all part ways, each to pursue their own destinies in their own way just like you did. A few months later, Ginger does indeed give birth to a new litter and teaches them about you and how you lived. (This is tempered by some common sense on her part though).\n\nAt last, a legacy worthy of an Alpha Wolf.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Stand firm and wait for him to charge", "result": "You briefly entertain the idea of rushing Igor, he wouldn't be able to get all of you, but you're not ready to risk death at the hands of some deformed assistant after you already killed Victor and Frankie. You need to buy some time.\n\n\"Alright Igor, just calm down. It's over Vic and Frankie are dead. You don't have to get pushed around by either one anymore and you got this whole castle as inheritance! I just did you a favor.\"\n\"A favor? A favor? You killed my younger brother you ASSHOLE!\"\n\nYou quickly put two and two together.\n\n\"Vic? Victor was your brother? Your younger brother?\"\n\"He damn well better have been, after all the abuse I took from him! You know what it's like being abused by your younger brother on a daily basis for YEARS?\"\n\"Not really, I killed all my brothers soon after we were born. I wasn't sharing. Survival of the fittest and all.\" You say dryly.\n\"Really? Well I envy you. I wish I had that option. But nooo. Mom liked Vic best. Vic was handsome. Vic wasn't deformed, Vic this. Vic that! Look after Vic, Igor. Make sure he doesn't get into trouble Igor. He's your younger brother and you have to protect him Igor. I was the first born! Why didn't Igor get any love?! I was the smart one!\"\n\"Yes you were. I mean if it hadn't been for you Vic wouldn't have even created Frankie.\" You say.\n\"Damn straight! I was the one who kept his ass alive! I'm the one that corrected all his idiot ideas when it came to updating Frankie! I'm not stupid like everyone says! I'm smart! And I demand respect! And I never fucking got it! I just got a fucking whip to the hump!\"\n\nAt this point Igor is ranting so much about hating his brother and his self-pity, he's not aiming his weapon at you any longer. You take advantage of the situation and rush at him, he's not quick enough to react and you knock him to the ground before eviscerating him. Oddly after all that ranting, he dies gurgling an apology.\n\n\"I'm sorry Vic\u0085I tried\u0085gurgle\u0085\"\n\nYou shake your head at Igor's misguided loyalty, while the Pack surrounds you.\n\n\"We won! You rule Wolf! What now?\" one of them asks.\n\"Dunno, didn't expect to survive really\u0085so did you get all this on camera Mary?\" you ask out loud, startling the wolflings.\n\nMary comes out of hiding, with a camcorder.\n\n\"How did you know I was here?\" she asks\n\"Please, I don't forget a scent, especially one that I know quite intimately. So let me guess. You're going to exploit this footage for financial gain right?\"\n\"Well yeah. When you left the studio I followed you a bit and found out you were heading here. At first I wanted to protect and help my family so I got here before you.\"\n\"What changed your mind?\"\n\"I realized what a bunch of miscreants and fuck ups they all were! What was I supposed to do? Be like Igor and stay loyal to a bunch of reprobates that wouldn't appreciate it anyway? It's not like they're REALLY my family. So I just decided to film the epic battle since you ruined my original movie by taking this lot with you.\"\n\"I take it you didn't care who won though.\"\n\"Not really, but if it makes you feel warm and squishy inside I suppose I was rooting for you more. You were the underdog after all\u0085hey! That's a great title for the movie!\" Mary exclaims.\n\nThe Wolflings get a little restless about all this.\n\"Hey shouldn't we do something, I mean she's part of this fucked up family, and she's trying to exploit us!\"\n\"Ah see now this is another lesson I can teach you guys. You don't need to be an asshole all the time, especially when there's some benefit for not doing so. A lesson I probably should've obeyed more when I was your age. Mary's little movie is made purely for exploitation, but its GOOD exploitation. It'll show everyone who we are and that we're NOT to be fucked with! This isn't some shitty family movie. This is raw footage of werewolves doing what they do best, kicking ass! We couldn't ask for better publicity. AND I assume we'll be getting some money for this right Mary?\"\n\nMary looks a little reluctant, but she realizes she has to give you something.\n\"Right Wolf.\"\n\"That's what I thought. Now the battle is good and all, but you'll need to pad it out more, I say you start doing interviews with us. We can make this into a documentary! If you need more footage, we can always go bust up a bar\u0085\"\n\nAnd so it happens, Mary releases \"Underdogs: The Inner Mind of the Wolf\" in a bunch of pansy art theatres at first where it's critically acclaimed. Later it gets released it regular theatres where most people like it mainly due to the brutal violence and your \"colorful\" interviews. You even win an award.\n\nThe movie makes Werewolves \"cool\" again and you're never out of work anymore, which is a good thing since Ginger gave birth to a litter of cubs which YOU have to pay to support!

Carefully avoiding traps, you travel further to different parts of the castle where the sweet smell starts getting so strong it's almost sickening, until you finally get to a closed door.\n\nYou open the door to an elegant bedroom.

Why are you here anyway?\" you ask again.\n\"I figured after you left the studio, you'd be in a wicked mood. I thought you'd probably just take your pack and smash up a bar or something. I followed you for a bit and found out you were planning on coming here. Look. I understand that my family has wronged you in many ways. My dad has, Frankie has, and I know I have, but I can't let you kill them. I know they're all fucked up and even I don't like them, but they're still my family such as they are. Wolf you already got your revenge a long time ago. I mean you beat the hell out of Frankie and ended his career and I heard tales about how you even killed my Dad once before he created either of us. What's this all going to prove? My dad isn't any match for you now. He's barely alive. Frankie has been just lying on a slab for years. Dad took him apart in an effort to fix him. That's the only experiment he's talking about and he's nowhere completed. Dad spends all his time with the insane idea of revitalizing Frankie for a come back. I tell him that it isn't going to happen, but he continues anyway. There's no battle here Wolf.
