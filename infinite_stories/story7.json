I thought everyone was at the orgy.\" She says.\n\"So did I\u0085um how come you aren't?\" you ask nervously.\n\"Eh not really my thing, how come you aren't?\"\n\"Same here.\"\n\"I see\u0085so what are you doing to pass the time?\"\n\"Keeping up on events to see if things will change for the better.\"\n\"Ah an optimist eh?\"\n\"Not really, I think I just get a kick out of living in a fantasy world and delusions to make myself feel better\u0085that and I have a morbid fascination of the utter chaos that's occurring throughout the world right now.\"\n\"Hmm, interesting approach to life\u0085I've always noticed you seem to keep to yourself.

I don't know why I thought things would change in the end\u0085ah fuck it the world's gonna end and it's probably a good thing if our co-workers are an example of humanity. Still\u0085I kind of wish I bought that bomb shelter\u0085\"\n\"So you don't want to die?\"\n\"Of course not! I just don't really see how to avoid it at this point.\"\n\"Well, for starters you could come with me; I'm getting ready to leave the city. It seems like things have died down for the most part out there, hopefully nobody's vandalized or stolen either of our vehicles.\" Marina suggests.\n\"What? Leave? And go where? It's not like there's any place really safe to go at this late stage.\"\n\"Sure there is. Look, I'll level with you, since you seem to be the only one here that's different. I stayed around here to see if there was anyone who was worthy enough to be saved, and apart from you, it pretty much looks like I wasted my time.\"\n\"Save? What do you mean?\"\n\"Well despite the fact that you kept to yourself and never took any interest in any of the private lives of your co-workers doesn't we don't have them.\" Marina laughs. \"But like you I never really mixed with any of our co-workers either, however unlike you I do have a very active social life filled with people who are close like a family, people who live clean and have a strong sense of freedom\u0085and who have been preparing for this day ever since the Commies started the first Cold War. You don't have to die and you don't have to be alone anymore. Come with me, you'll be accepted as long as you're willing to work hard and from what I know, you aren't averse to doing that.\"\n\nYou're not entirely sure of what Marina has in store for you, but it sounds better than staying here waiting to die. You agree to leave with her. You both make your way past the mass of naked bodies and head immediately to the parking structure. Unfortunately Marina's car is gone, it's been predictably stolen in the looting frenzy during the city exodus; however your old van is perfectly fine. It hasn't even been vandalized, of course the thing looks like it's already been vandalized which is probably why nobody bothered to steal it. You both get in the van and you drive while Marina tells you where you're going.\n\nWhile you're driving through the city, you keep expecting to be attacked by lawless hold outs still lingering in the city or open fired on by Nation Guardsman, but you suspect either they were ordered to pull out to reinforce a more important city or most of them abandoned their \"job\" long ago when they realized the futility of it. You make your way out of the city with no problems. Of course now you're just wondering if you're just going to get nuked at any second. You listen to the radio to keep up on events, which is more of the same that you were watching on TV. Eventually Marina turns it off and tells you not to worry about the old world anymore, a new one is going to be built.\n\nYour drive takes you far from the city, where ever Marina's leading you it's even further than where you live and you lived pretty way out. You drive through the night and into next morning; while Marina's asleep you turn the radio back on and keep it on low\u0085\n\nMonday 8:00 AM\n\n\"\u0085BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u0085\"\n\nThe radio suddenly stops broadcasting anything except a loud warning sound; it wakes up Marina before you can turn it off. Seeing her current surroundings, Marina hastily tells you to turn at a dirty road that's coming up, which then leads into a wooden gate. Looks like a compound of some sort, where a man is standing guard with an assault rifle. Marina gets out and talks to him a moment, to which he nods his head and opens the gate.\n\nAs soon as you drive in another woman comes running out of one of the many log cabin like structures in the compound. She immediately starts talking to Marina through the passenger window.\n\n\"Marina! Thank God you're here! We thought you were dead! Come on we gotta get down into the underground, its beginning!\"\n\nWasting no time Marina and you follow the woman into the cabin and down into a trap door in the floor. You find yourself in a wide tunnel with dim electrical lighting to what looks like a pretty elaborate underground complex. Marina and the woman are running ahead of you, but you can't help but stare in wonder of all this.\n\n\"Holy shit, they really were working on this since the Cold War\u0085\" you say to yourself as you slow down to examine everything.\n\nThen it happens. You hear a loud noise above and you fall to the ground due to the tremors. Then all the lighting goes out. You attempt to get back up and try to feel the walls to get your bearings. You don't know where the hell you're going, but you can hear voices and shouting; some of it close and some of it far away. You have no idea where the hell you're at, let alone the layout of this place. Instead of getting yourself lost, you decide to just stay put until the lighting comes back on; surely they probably have an emergency generator that will kick in soon.\n\nThe lighting suddenly comes on and you're just in time to see Marina and a man dressed fatigues arrive on your position.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Marina asks you.\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.\"\n\nNo sooner do you get out those words when the man in military fatigues begins giving you the hard stare.\n\n\"I've heard about you before from Marina, but don't think that hiding behind her skirt is gonna give you a fuckin' free pass in this place! You better prepared to pull your goddamn weight everyday! I catch you slipping and you're outta here!\"\n\"What the hell? I didn't say anything!\"\n\"And you better not say any fuckin' thing either if you don't wanna get on my bad side! The Colonel doesn't like slack offs in his compound and neither do I! So if you intend on staying here, you better get REAL used to the idea of getting your head outta your fuckin' ass and living like a real fuckin' person instead of the goddamn disgusting parasitic shit maggot you are!\"\n\nYou're about to reply to GI Jerk, but Marina stops you and insists on taking you to your room, leaving Harry to his own devices.\n\n\"Alright Marina, what the hell was all that about, and who's full metal asshole back there?\"\n\"That was Harry, and don't pay any attention to him, he's just really gung ho and is second in command around here. The Colonel is the one who runs this place. He's actually a more even tempered man than Harry is.\"\n\nMarina and you arrive at a small room by itself at the end of one of the corridors.\n\n\"Well here's the room you'll be staying for now. Things might change mind you, but rest assured this is the safest place you could be right now. We've prepared for this day and will definitely survive the aftermath of what's to come, and now you will too.\"\n\nMarina leaves with a smile, but you don't really share her optimism, given the fact that Armageddon has just happened. That reality has only just now sunk in that the world is probably one big radioactive desert at this point.\n\nThen again, Marina might be right, this place is probably safer than most and its better than being dead. At least you hope it is. You lie down on the bed provided and fall asleep; surprisingly it's the best rest you've experienced before the bombs dropped.\n\nA few weeks pass and you get acquainted with the compound. You and most of the others are to remain underground while until some scouts in radiation suits determine if the radiation level is low enough. In the mean time you're forced to do extensive combat training like everyone else. Most of the people are okay with you, even though you're an outsider. Harry gives you a hard time though. Still, you're probably in the best shape of your life and you got to brush up on your aim. Sometimes you get to spend time with Marina, funny how you find it easier to talk to her now. One day you finally see the Colonel you've been hearing about, he gives a speech to all of you in the cafeteria.\n\n\"Well, I've been informed that the surface part of our compound only suffered minor damage and that the radiation level is fairly low all things considering\u0085anyway we all knew this day would come, and we would be prepared for it, but we can't just sit on our asses hoping things will be alright! NO! We must take a proactive approach if we have to survive! As we speak, there are probably low lives scavenging the shell of the old world, we must secure as many abandoned resources as we can to ensure our future and some of you will be sent out into the world to do just that for the good of the compound. We're going to tame this new world and rebuild a new society! You have undergone rigorous training before hand, to ensure you will be able to survive the dangers. Now I'll be accepting volunteers first.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Volunteer", "result": "Maybe you're high on your new found physique and adrenaline, but for whatever reason, something comes over you to volunteer. Indeed you've made everyone a little surprised by your actions especially since you're an outsider. The Colonel looks at you with interest.\n\n\"Hmm, you're the one I've heard about from Marina, didn't expect you to volunteer, she's always mentioned you're quiet loner type. Then again, you might be just what I need\u0085alright you're coming with me. Harry, you start picking some of the others and form recon detachments. Everyone goes on assignment tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Colonel then takes you to his office, where he sits down and gets a bunch of papers from his desk.\n\n\"Okay, I'm sure during your short stay here, you probably think we're all a bunch of survivalist militia loonies, and to a certain extent, we probably are, however we aren't without a plan.\"\n\nThe Colonel shows you some blueprints to what looks to be a small military base.\n\n\"My friend Alex was stationed at this base. It's not exactly close by, but its closest military base around here.\"\n\"Didn't realize there were any military bases in the area.\"\n\"Most people don't, it was a top secret, and kept off the records so it wouldn't be targeted. There aren't even any roads leading to the place, you have travel by foot. Though I guess you could say it wasn't so much of a military base as it was a research facility. Obviously I know about it, because I had a friend stationed there who was feeding me information. He didn't exactly run the place, but he was attempting to work his way up to get special level clearance. Apparently GZS was working with the government on some high tech weaponry.\"\n\"GZS?\"\n\"The Ground Zero Survival Corporation. I'm sure you've heard of them, they were the ones hawking their Shelters like snake oil salesmen before doomsday.\"\n\"Oh yeah, I used to see their commercials on late at night, I thought about buying one of those.\"\n\"Well good thing you didn't, only an idiot would've bought one of those things. Look at this.\"\n\nThe Colonel now shows you a schematic of a GZS Shelter.\n\n\"Why? It certainly looks just as equipped as this compound and has a lot more conveniences.\" You remark.\n\"It would appear that way, but the fucking thing is a death trap. They engineered them so once you entered; you most likely couldn't get out of them. Supposedly the GZS computer is supposed to let you out when it deems that it's safe to do so. In fact the whole thing is controlled by the computer. A computer that could glitch and break down at anytime. Let a machine be in charge of your survival\u0085yeah great idea. I dunno about you, but I'll take this compound any day. It might not look pretty, but I don't have to worry about getting trapped with no access to food or water. Not to mention I heard from Alex that they suffered cutback during the creation of most of those things meaning they cut a lot of damn corners, so they probably aren't as state of the art as they claimed. I'll bet those dumb bastards who are living in those things are regretting it as we speak.\"\n\nYou're not sure where he's going with all this so you interrupt.\n\n\"So, what does all this mean? Are we going to seek out these shelters and rescue the people inside?\"\n\"What?! HA HA! That's a good one!\" The Colonel laughs. \"Hell no son, as far as I'm concerned they've made their choice now they can live with it, we're not here to play white knight. We have to look out for ourselves, and part of that is making sure we're the best defended and from what I heard, whatever they were working on in that base, sounds like it would make things a lot easier in the defense department.\"\n\"Whoa, hold on, if this is a military base won't they just shoot me on sight if I go there I mean won't it be heavily guarded? I mean I know I went through some training, but I doubt to the degree that I can take on an entire military base!\"\n\"Alex was making friends with most of the lower personnel there, getting them to follow him as it were. Last I heard, he was pretty successful, so chances are, as long as I gave you some identifiers to take with you proving that you were following my orders, you wouldn't have any problems when you arrived, but obviously there IS a problem or I wouldn't be sending you at all.\"\n\"Of course\u0085\" you say expecting this assignment to be even more complicated.\n\"I haven't heard anything from Alex for a month before the bombs dropped. I dunno what's happened to him.\"\n\"Is it possible they discovered he was leaking information and killed him?\"\n\"I suppose, but chances are that afterwards they would've found out about us and also sent the National Guard as well as GZS private security here to lay waste to this compound.\"\n\"Well the National Guard were busy trying to maintain order to the major cities at the time. I should know I was there when they were stationed in the one I was working at.\"\n\"True, but I still think they would've sent someone here, and GZS still would have. As I said they had enough money to pay for their own security force. Maybe not as well trained as military personnel, but fanatical enough to eliminate anyone that GZS thought was discovering secrets about them. That's why Alex always focused on solely making friends with the grunts and government officials. The GZS employees always seemed a bit more dedicated to their corporation.\"\n\"Okay, well is it possible that the base wasn't so secret and it got hit after all?\"\n\"Nope, mainly because I get the impression the background radiation level would be a hell of a lot higher, if that got nuked, so I'm pretty sure the place is intact, in fact I'm guessing its been abandoned. We recently figured out their frequency, we never used it before for obvious reasons, but now, why not? We're getting a signal, but no verbal answers from anyone. To sum up, I want you to go there to scout and explore as much as you can. Find out what the hell happened to Alex if possible, and let me know if that high tech weaponry is worth anything or just more bad engineering by GZS. Here. You'll probably need this security pass to enter, got it from Alex, last time he was here; I hope it's still valid. And here's my ring and a letter, if Alex IS still alive then those will prove that you're working for me. That's all I can do to help other than to give you a map to the place and what equipment you think you'll need.\"\n\nBefore you leave you have to ask.\n\n\"Okay why me?\"\n\"Why you? You volunteered son!\"\n\"I know, but for this particular job, surely you have others more qualified to tackle it.\"\n\"Eh\u0085you MIGHT think that, but to be quite honest, no. I mean don't get me wrong I see all of these people here as family, but a lot of them are a bunch of weekend warriors who were playing survival. I'm sure in the years to come we're going to see who's a REAL soldier and who isn't. Not that it matters, I mean I'll find something for them to do, but you're different. You certainly aren't some commando, but there's definitely something about you that makes you seem a bit more\u0085detached from everything else. Like you'll be willing to do what's necessary to survive without hesitation. While you may never have been in a situation like this one, I got a feeling you'll do just fine. Besides Marina's previous beaming remarks about you are good enough for me. Now go get some rest, you'll be leaving tomorrow.\"\n\nYou head back to your room and think about what the Colonel said. He might be right in a lot of ways, but you still wonder if he's sending you because as he said, \"All these people here are like family, but you're different.\" Maybe if you get killed it won't feel like such a loss. You don't think anymore about it, mainly because Marina enters your room to interrupt your thoughts.\n\n\"I hear you're leaving tomorrow, I just want to tell you how brave I think you are for doing this for all of us. I know we didn't get a lot of quality time with each other, but I wanted us to spend at least what could be the last time I see you together.\"\n\nMarina's ominous words that imply how much danger you're possibly getting yourself into might worry you more if she wasn't on top of you right now\u0085\n\nThe next day you load up with what you think you might need, water, food, rifle, pistol, knife, Geiger counter, all the basic essentials. You get a bunch of goodbyes and good lucks. Harry merely sneers and mentions he expects you to get yourself killed twenty feet after you leave. The Colonel is a little more supportive and gives you a silent salute, but you like Marina's goodbye kiss best of all.\n\nAnd with that, you're on your way. It's actually amazing to see that the outside world doesn't look drastically different, you can only assume the bombs didn't hit near your area. When you're out of sight of the compound, you go back to thinking about this mission you volunteered for and wondering if you should go through with it. You do have the suitable equipment and skills to survive off the land after all.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to just go AWOL as it were\u0085", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue with your mission", "result": "You volunteered and you're going to see it through, might not be that dangerous as you think especially if the place is indeed abandoned.\n\nYou spend a few days crossing over hills and some plains. For awhile you think someone's following you, but never see a soul, actually you're wondering about the Geiger counter readings more than anything, but you're guessing there wasn't any nuclear blast the direction you're going. You also guess that seeing trees up ahead is also a good sign. You would've dressed yourself in a radiation suit, but the Colonel kept insisting it wouldn't be necessary and for the mission that Harry was sending some of the others on would need them more.\n\n\"Shit! I forgot to take a radio!\" you say to yourself finally realizing that it would've been nice to radio in to the Compound if you had something important to report, like being unable to enter the base because snipers were shooting at you.\n\nHappily that doesn't seem to occur when you finally arrive. You almost aren't even sure if you're at the right place at first. The Compound is bigger, then again this place probably has an extensive underground, and as the Colonel said, it was more like a research facility than a proper military base.\n\nStill there's something a little weird about all this, it seems like security would be of major importance for a place like this, yet there's nobody here guarding the outside and you just walked through open gates. Maybe the place is abandoned, but they could all be underground though, (That would certainly be more sensible than wandering around exposing themselves to radioactive wind\u0085)\n\nThe surface offices and barracks don't look like anyone left in a hurry; in fact a lot of the barracks still have their equipment. (You take some extra ammo for your assault rifle) You search through some of papers you find in the offices, but there's nothing of any importance. Just mundane status reports of personnel guard duties. You find a few letters with GZS logos on them, but again nothing telling you much.\n\nNothing else for it, but to go underground. You approach the solid metal structure at the far end of the base. Looks like an elevator door with an ATM machine near it. There's a slot and some button, so you're guessing this is where you shove your security pass that the Colonel gave you. Hope it works or you came all this way for nothing. You slide the pass in the slot.\n\n\"Identification recognized. GZS wishes you a pleasant day in all your endeavors sir!\" a chipper female voice sounds as the elevator door opens.\n\nNot exactly what you were expecting, GZS must've had more input here than the Colonel thought. You're a little nervous as you press the elevator button down, you expect the worst. The elevator eventually reaches its destination and opens up to a corridor. You cautiously exit. You don't get far when a cybernetic being comes from around a corner and points its arm at you, which is doubling as a weapon of some sort, one that would blow a big hole in you.\n\n\"Lower your weapon and please come with me sir. Alex will want to see you. Any attempt to attack or escape will be met with extreme use of force.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Open fire and run", "result": "You unload a clip into the cyborg, not knowing if your bullets are going to hurt it or not. You manage to do something since you knock it to the ground and you see it spark, before you head for the elevator.\n\n\"Hostile detected! Enacting defense systems!\" a robotic voice echoes. You begin to panic when the elevator refuses to open and more cybernetic beings come at you. You can't stop them, and you expect a quick death by their weapons, but unfortunately that doesn't occur.\n\nInstead they knock you out and take you to Alex. When you come to you're lying naked, tied to an operating table with a bunch of tubes in you. Alex is hovering over you with a scalpel. He's obviously deranged.\n\n\"Well I see I didn't use enough anesthesia, I'll have to apply more\u0085I also see by this letter and his ring the Colonel sent you. Probably all a ruse of friendship to kill me no doubt. I never did trust him. Well his loss will be my gain. I'm going to remake you. Better, stronger, faster. Just like the Million Dollar Man, except this won't cost any money, just my time. I've been studying about some new cybernetic implants I want to test. I think I know enough about the procedure for it to be successful. You'll thank me for this, trust me. L17 hand me the bone saw.\"\n\nYou pass out again, which is just as well since Alex butchers your body trying to \"remake\" you.

Alex promises to give us a tune up when he gets the necessary time, he is only one man after all. Some assistants would certainly help.\"\n\"So Alex is a surgeon?\"\n\"Well he's not really. I mean he didn't start out that way at least, but he's completely self taught and trying to learn more each day! Sure there have been some failures, but there's also been success! Why look at m-m-m-m.\" the cyborg hits itself in the head again while you just shake yours. You can see this is going to be an interesting meeting.\n\n\"So who were you before Alex\u0085uh improved you.\"\n\"Oh I was a regular military man who guarded this base with no real identity. Just a name and a number really.\"\n\"And now?\"\n\"Now I'm known as J-34 and I protect Alex!\"\n\"That's great\u0085 so everyone here is a cyborg like you?\"\n\"Just about. Most military personnel were friends with Alex before being renewed, so they were happy to be improved. The GZS personnel weren't so enthusiastic about the idea, in fact they were mad that Alex discovered their top secret project. They tried to stop him, but they were stopped instead. Alex saw that the project would be pointless in trying to perfect it to use in a war that was going to be over in six minutes. Better that it should be applied to those that would surely survive the aftermath of that same war. Here we are, I'm sure Alex will want to hear all about the outside world, hey maybe he'll improve you too!\"\n\nYou enter an office where a man sits at a desk pouring over technical manuals and medical books. Two more cyborgs armed with some sort science fictionish weapons stand by him. There's no way you could hope to kill him without them killing you as well. He looks up.\n\n\"Ah a guest! Been a long time since we've seen anyone new\u0085in fact I'm a little puzzled on how you even found this place, let alone entered it\u0085you're not GZS are you?\" Alex says changing his pleasant demeanor in mid sentence.\n\"No! Not at all! I'm here because the Colonel sent me. He says you and he are friends. Here. Here's his ring and a letter he wrote to prove it. He'd also given me a security pass so I could enter this place.\"\n\nAlex takes the ring and letter and inspects them both, before addressing you again.\n\n\"Well it looks like everything's legitimate. I shall trust you. Though I'm not sure I trust the Colonel. I never did trust him. He only wanted to use me so I could get access to high tech weaponry, but instead I found much more here! Much more than I ever told him! Ha ha! I hear him trying to radio in, wondering if there's anyone here, I've been ignoring him. He and his group of right wing loonies are unworthy of being re-made. If they think they're true survivialists then they don't need the gifts that this base provides. All of it is mine, I EARNED this place and it shall be I who ushers in a new era. Not GZS, not the government and not the fucking goddamn Colonel!\"\n\nAlex is obviously unhinged, you don't know if he was always this way or got that way later, but it hardly matters, what's of major importance is that you walk away from this meeting unscathed. You try to calm him down.\n\n\"Whoa hold on, I don't think the Colonel or any of his right wing loonies would want to be re-made.\"\n\"Nonsense, anyone with any sense of survival would want to be re-made if they new about what was being worked on here.\"\n\nYou can't help, but notice that Alex hasn't done any improvements on himself\u0085\n\n\"However, I can see you don't share that same short sighted thinking that the rest of those Compound cronies do. You are worthy of being re-made! In fact I would like to start now, I've been studying up on some new techniques and I would love to test them out. I think I could do a really good job this time, there will definitely be less acc\u0085er complications than in the past.\"\n\nThis is just getting worse. Now this nutjob wants to work on you.\n\n\"Look, I don't want to be re-made! I was just here to see if you were alive and scout this place out! Now that I've done that, I'm to return to the Compound!\"\n\"Oh well now that's going to be a problem\u0085I can't risk you telling him what's here.\"\n\nYou really didn't want to hear that.\n\n\"Look, I'll tell the Colonel that there wasn't anything here, I can reason with him. You can even take my security pass to make sure I can't get back in if you're really worried. However, if he doesn't hear from me, he's only going to send more folks to this place.\"\n\"And what of it? They wouldn't be able to get in and even if they could, his weekend warriors would be no match for Cybernetic Evolution!\"\n\"No, but they could just blow up the elevator trapping you down here forever, and you'll never be able to leave to allow your genius to usher in the new era that you were talking about.\"\n\nThat seems to relax Alex a bit, as always a little flattery goes a long way to ease an unbalanced mind.\n\n\"Hmm, perhaps you make some sense, and you seem like a trustworthy sort\u0085very well. I shall arrange for you to leave. Give me your security pass.\"\n\"Okay, and I'll be needing the Colonel's ring and letter back, so I can say I didn't find anything here.\"\n\nYou and Alex exchange items and he and his two cyborg guards escort you back to the elevator.\n\n\"Goodbye, perhaps if we meet again you will be more receptive to being re-made. It's a harsh new world, and you'll soon wish you had an edge to survive it.\" Alex tells you before you leave.\n\n\"I'll do alright.\"\n\nThe elevator goes up and you're back on the surface again where you make your trek back to the compound in just a few days. You notice there have been a few changes in the few days you've left. Namely there's a still to make hooch. And you now have some working vehicles that been modified to run on hooch. The same still that people are making cheap booze from they're also using it as fuel, which basically translates into the vehicles running on \"garbage\" given that's what the booze is being made out of. Smells pretty bad, but whatever works. Though from what you heard some towns have been found to be running their vehicles on shit (animal AND human) so the smell could be worse. There's been a couple deaths from some of the other recon missions, but for the most part everything else is normal.\n\nEveryone's almost surprised to see you come back, Marina's happy, Harry obviously isn't. The Colonel though wants to see you immediately.\n\nSince you don't owe any allegiance to some nutcase playing Frankenstein in an underground base, you tell the Colonel everything. You expect him to get mad at you, but he doesn't.\n\n\"(Sigh) Alex always was a bit unstable; I always wondered why the army never gave him a section 8. Anyway, what you're telling me doesn't surprise me, though I wish you could've gotten away without giving up that security pass. It's going to be harder to get down there now.\"\n\"You still want to go down there?\"\n\"Of course! What you think I'm going to let Alex slowly refine and build up his cyborg army? Who do you think he's going to attack first? No, we need to get rid of him NOW. I suppose we could blow up the elevator doors to gain access. Not like we don't have the means to do that.\"\n\"Yeah, but don't you run the risk of blowing up the entire elevator, and causing it fall and crash down the shaft? We wouldn't be able to send anyone down there in an efficient manner. Let alone fighting off cyborgs who would cut us down with ease if we were trying to repel down the shaft or huddled together coming off the elevator, besides Alex might have left the elevator on his level given the recent visit of mine.\"\n\nThe Colonel lets forth another sigh knowing that you make a good point, but frustrated as well.\n\n\"You're right, so what do you suggest we do then? Sit and do nothing with our thumbs up our asses?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Suggest in hacking the security system, then invading the base", "result": "\"Well I suppose you're right in that we need to stop Alex, but blowing up the elevator still isn't going to help, I suggest we hack the security system to gain control of it properly and then send down the invasion force and hope we can deal with the robots and cyborgs down there.\" You reply.\n\"Sounds like a better plan, I didn't know you had so much computer experience though, let alone able to hack into a secret army base.\"\n\"Huh? I don't. I mean, don't you have people like that here?\"\n\"Excuse me, but you seem to be new here, hello welcome to the Compound\u0085NO OF COURSE I DON'T I HAVE ANYONE LIKE THAT HERE! Sheesh! It's not like we figured advanced computer hacking skills are going to be that useful when the world is blown back to the stone age! So you mean you don't have the ability to pull off this amazing plan of yours?\"\n\"Well, not really, not to that degree at least\u0085I suppose there's just taking the panel apart and re-wiring it so it opens up for us though, you got any electricians or someone of that nature?\"\n\"Yeah a few, but I hope you do too, because you're going to assist the team since you're the idea man for all of this. After you clean out all the cyborgs and whatever the hell else Alex has built down there, remember to grab those weapons and come back. We'll go back to occupy the base later. Now go select your team and whatever else you think you might need.\"\n\nAfter asking for the names of the electronically \"gifted\" around the place, you go about following the Colonel's orders and saying goodbye to Marina again, she looks more confident that you'll return this time, you wish you could feel the same.\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you're in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard. Looks like your friend Alex also dabbles in robotics as well as cybernetics. You and your team hide behind the outer wall when you all catch sight of it. Apparently Alex didn't trust you any more than you trusted him, and looks like both of you were right.\n\n\"Uh, what's that?\" one of your team members asks.\n\"It's a robot, what's it look like?\"\n\"Well what're we gonna do?\"\n\"Kill it! Everyone open fire!\"\n\nYou have no idea if your bullets are going to penetrate its armor, but you you're going to try anyway. Everyone fires upon the robotic being, which begins to shutter and spark, but returns fire and a bright burst of light strikes one of your team members and completely incinerates him.\n\n\"Holy shit, get cover and keep firing!\" you shout.\n\nThe rest of the battle doesn't last too much longer, while your team continue to fire bursts at the machine while they dodge plasma blasts, you get enough time to toss a grenade at it and blow it to smithereens. Shards of burnt twisted metal lie all over the place.\n\n\"Come on we need to open up that door, before something else comes out of the damn thing!\"\n\nYou and a few others start working on the card reader, trying to get it open as fast as possible. You don't even know how you're going to rewire the damn thing; you'll just keep doing something until something else happens! As it turns out you didn't need to do anything, while you and few others are fumbling around, the elevator doors open. At first you think you it was you who opened them, but in fact it was Alex who was controlling the elevator from the bottom. Two heavily armed cyborgs exit and begin firing immediately turning most of your team into charred skeletons. You manage to just barely get away and duck behind one of the buildings. Fortunately they don't seem to be very fast, so when they try to chase you, you toss a few grenades in their direction, blowing them up in the same manner you destroyed the robot, except a bit bloodier, given their human bits.\n\nYou come out of your hiding place and see nothing left of your team, they've all been killed. The elevator door is still open; you could enter and finish the job, or return to the Compound in failure.", "action_results": [{"action": "Enter", "result": "You take a deep breath and enter the elevator taking it down.

You pull it out and see it's a tranquilizer dart. Already you feel drowsy, and begin to collapse. You ban barely make him out in your current state, but Alex soon enters with a victorious look on his face, holding his tranquilizer gun.\n\n\"Well, it looks like I was right to not trust you, but you'll be able to repay me back soon enough. Trust me, you'll thank me for this remaking.\"\n\nDespite Alex's claims you're unable to do much talking at all after Alex remakes you, let alone thanking him. He basically designs you in such a way that only your basic brain functions remain.

You'd radio in, but one of the other team members was carrying it, and he was fricasseed. Plus you don't want to be around if anymore of Alex's creations come up. Time for a full scale invasion, looks like the Colonel was right.\n\nAnd that's just what the Colonel tells you, when he's chewing your ass out for losing valuable people and equipment in an attempt to go through with your plan. His respect for you is severely lowered, in fact the entire Compound's respect for you is lowered. Harry makes every effort to taunt you, and even Marina becomes distant. (Obviously you weren't the \"man\" she thought you were.) Your status in the Compound is pretty much nil, when the Colonel finally organizes an invasion party; you of course aren't included.\n\nNow knowing another invasion attempt is probably coming, Alex really beefed up his defenses; the invasion force doesn't even set foot into the base before getting blasted by superior cyborg weaponry. Reinforcements are called in, but they don't help. The base is too well defended now. A retreat is called, and the Compound has to abandon its invasion indefinitely. In fact all exploration is called off; since the Colonel decides he can't afford to lose anyone else. (One of the only reasons why you're kept around) The Compound just becomes a \"place\" where everyone lives because it's safer than living outside it. The ideas of \"rebuilding\" civilization are abandoned. Morale certainly isn't what it used to be.\n\nOf course none of that means shit to Alex, who only steps up his plans for conquest.\n\nA year passes without another incident and then the day happens which you all hoped would never happen, but somehow expected it would. Alex's army arrives, and what's worse is they now outnumber you. Alex must've been capturing people in the wastelands or something. He's also improved his abilities, they're even tougher, and worse they're faster.\n\nYou don't have anywhere else to go, and this place is your home such as it is. You figure maybe you can regain some respect by defending the place.\n\nYou and the rest prepare to defend the Compound. Harry is predictably yelling orders at everyone, while the Colonel is attempting to boost morale with inspirational speeches.

We blow up the elevator like you wanted to do and then dump explosives down the shaft, it should collapse things enough that they won't be able to leave, and we won't lose any people.\"\n\"Ah, I like the way you think, but suppose they attempt get out, or rebuild the elevator or something?\"\n\"Well, we could leave a permanent detachment there to keep a constant vigil. I mean the surface part of the base is completely usable. That way we get an early warning just in case anything does try to come out.\"\n\"Interesting idea. Having two command centers would be a good idea, I was planning on expansion in the future, might as well start now. Should keep us alert as well. Can't afford to get sloppy out here. Okay. We'll go with that idea, and since you came up with it, you can oversee the operation. In fact consider yourself stationed there until further notice.\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"Hey I have to put someone there, you've done a good job so far and you have the best experience with the place so you can be in charge.

Yeah, he's got his uses, but I'd rather not have him in charge of anything important like this, no I want you and few others to go, in fact you pick them. I'll let you know if I can afford to spare them.\"\n\"Well then I pick Marina right now.\"\n\"I expected that. Sure, if you can convince her to go. Just remember what you're there for! Okay go pick out your team and gather what equipment you might need.\"\n\nYou leave and tell Marina the situation immediately, she of course agrees to go with you, though she's a little worried about being someplace with a bunch of cyborgs several feet underneath her, of course you're worried about the same thing.\n\nYou pick out six more people of varying skills, but mostly people you were getting along with during your stay at the Compound. You don't want to take anyone who you're not going to get along with. The Colonel approves of your choice and gives you the okay, Harry looks positively jealous that he was passed over for you who just got here.

You don't feel like arguing with him though since it won't accomplish anything, besides if any good is coming from this, it's getting away from him. You and your team leave.\n\nWhen you and your team get to the base in a few days, you're in for a little surprise. A medium sized robot is patrolling the courtyard.

Just like you though, Alex doesn't have the elevator on the surface anymore, it's at the bottom, in fact its ascending right now!\n\n\"Dump grenades down the fuckin' shaft!\"\n\nThis action is followed by running far away from the elevator, a large explosion, and then a large crash and another smaller explosion. You ask for a flashlight and peer down the shaft. Its smoking mess and from what you can tell, part of the structure collapsed in on itself. Nothing is going to be coming out of there for a long time. You're about to radio in and tell the Colonel the news when another signal breaks in, its Alex\u0085\n\n\"So, that snitch told after all! I knew he wasn't to be trusted! You can't stop me! I'll get out of here eventually! And I shall\u0085\"\n\"Got news for you Alex, you're talking to the snitch right now, and you won't be going anywhere as long as I'm here. Enjoy your underground prison.\"\n\nYou switch to another frequency and tell the Colonel who seems pleased, he tells you he'll keep in contact with you on a regular basis and send more people when possible, in the mean time secure the place and get settled in.\n\nA few more weeks pass and eventually the initial nervousness disappears from everyone, Alex still breaks in ranting on your radio frequency every now and then, but you ignore him. In fact being at the base turns out to be more to your liking, there's less people around, you're in charge and you get to spend more time with Marina.\n\nA year passes\u0085\n\nNot too much changes around the base (Which you now call Pandora which seems appropriate since you're keeping in something that shouldn't be let out!) a few more people are transferred here, supplies are delivered back and forth, but not much else happens. You get reports from the Compound every now and then, seems they've made progress with a few small towns that survived, but there are a lot of problems with lawless bandits running around. Reports have also mentioned strange mutated animals lurking about too. Sounds like they have everything under control so far though. The Colonel has the idea to trade with the towns and offer protection when possible. He hopes to get more people to join the Compound you imagine.\n\nYour orders are still the same, just guard Pandora, and make sure no cybernetic horrors are coming out. Sometimes you wonder if you shouldn't be doing something else, indeed Marina seems to think so. Sometimes you forget she's been training in all this survivalist shit longer than you have and has that \"tame the wasteland\" spirit more than you do.", "action_results": [{"action": "Stay put", "result": "You decide that you got it made, why fuck with it?

You continue your routine.\n\nFour more years pass\u0085\n\nIt's been five years and you and Marina are still together, but for some reason, you don't seem as close anymore. It seems like she's been getting distant in the past few years.\n\nYou still get the harassing radio rant from Alex every now and then just to let you know he's still alive along with his robots and cyborgs. You're guessing he's been surviving on rats and roaches down there.\n\nIt's been five years since you first joined the Compound and there's been a lot more changes there at least that's what you've been hearing from the people transferred to Pandora.\n\nYou get less and less reports from the Compound itself other than its undergone a name change and due to its inclusion of a few towns now, its called the Combine and the Compound itself is called Fort Justice. You know about how the Colonel has gotten sick and seems to be getting worse as more time passes and how the population rate is growing, but it's slow. The major theory is the elevated levels of background radiation are probably affecting fertility. (You wonder about yourself and Marina since she hasn't once gotten pregnant in the five years you've been together) There have been more people sent here, mainly people that aren't \"cutting it\" anymore at the Compound. In fact you've been hearing some interesting stories. One man in particular called Roger has spoken to you quite frankly about what's been going on at the Compound some of it a bit alarming.\n\n\"The fuckin' Colonel? When he started getting sick that sonofabitch Harry started taking over more responsibility. Started doing shit HIS way, which was a lot more reactionary. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm not some faggot peacenik, I'm all about creating a new strong society, like how America SHOULD'VE been, but fuck man. I'm not gonna kill children for no goddamn reason!\"\n\"What?! When did this happen?\"\n\"About a year ago! I was on a mission to this small town called Lost Springs and Harry was with us personally. They had a fresh underground supply of water, so we really wanted to gather them into the fold. Talks didn't go so well though, so Harry went nuts and shot the fucking mayor of the town! Then he proceeded to tell us to start killing all the kids if they didn't submit to us.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"Well I refused to do it, and some of the others didn't either. A few did though, and after a couple of kids were killed. The rest of the townsfolk pretty much fell in line. Harry left the ones who were willing to kill at his command to occupy the place. He made up a damn story to the Colonel about how he HAD to do it and left out the shooting kids though. And the Colonel gets sicker and sicker, and Harry gets freer reign. Shit, if the Colonel wasn't still alive I think Harry wouldn't even be sending some people here, he'd probably be sending them all to the city.\"\n\"Wait, the city? There's missions to the city? I thought those were stopped after the first few times that was attempted.\"\n\"Not anymore! Harry's been sending a few people on his shit list to missions on the city. Harry says that there are still important resources to be gathered from there. Its bullshit, ain't nothin' there except fuckin' mutants and radioactivity! I probably would've got sent there, but I lost my arm in an ambush, and the Colonel said I needed to be taken off of active duty and sent here. There's a real mean motherfucker loyal to Harry called Damon, who goes on the city missions to ensure nobody tries to go AWOL. He's fucking nuts, he loves going into the city; I think he actually gets a fucking orgasm.\"\n\"Where the hell is Harry getting all these new people, if he's treating the towns so badly?\"\n\"I told you he's been press ganging some of them and most are so beaten by that point that they just go along with it, but he's also been subduing some of the raider scum! That\nDamon is one of those fuckers. Instead of killing them all like we should be doing, he's been recruiting them into the Combine! These degenerates are usually the ones he uses for occupation since most of them don't have any qualms about killing anything that moves and they're used to terrorizing towns.\"\n\"Holy shit, I've never heard about all this before.\"\n\"I'm telling you, you're lucky you got assigned here when you did, because you\nwould've been going to the city. The only thing keeping you safe is the Colonel who insists you stay in charge of this place; I don't want to think about the day when the Colonel finally croaks. Shit, I might just leave and take my chances, one arm be damned. YOU might want to think about leaving as well, because chances are Harry's going to be turning his attention towards you when that day comes.\"\n\"I still don't see what the hell I did to him, he's hated me since day one.\"\n\"Well, you got the Colonel's attention and his respect. You got a command position of your very own base, and most importantly you got Marina. He's always liked her. You didn't know?\"\n\"Well she did mention one time that he came on to her in the past, well anyway, it hardly matters why he hates me I guess. What matters is I gotta think about how I'm gonna deal with this problem in the future.\"\n\nSuddenly one of your assistants comes in and has something to report. Something you really don't want to know after having been given the recent information by Roger.\n\nThe Colonel has died, Harry has taken complete control of the Combine and his first order is for YOU to return to Fort Justice for reassignment.\n\nLooks like you'll have to be thinking fast.", "action_results": [{"action": "Leave the Combine", "result": "Secession isn't really a viable option. You simply can't stand up to the resources Harry has, the only option is to distance yourself as far away as possible. Harry's escorts will be here in a few days so you start packing immediately. Marina wonders what you're doing.\n\n\"We're getting the hell outta here! You think Harry's gonna let me live? At best he might be sending me into missions into the city! Fuck that!\"\n\"You mean we're just leaving? We're not fighting back?\"\n\"What you think I like this? I mean I don't want to leave, but if we stay, we're gonna end up dead! Come on pack your shit.\"\n\"I dunno. I can't just leave everything. I mean I'm still friends and close to all these people, I can't just leave them.\"\n\"Look, I've actually gotten along with most of the folks here too, but I'm not sticking my neck out for any of them. Besides, if they're smart they'll leave too.\"\n\"I can't do it, I can't go.\"\n\nYou stop packing.\n\n\"What, are you fucking kidding me?\"\n\"No, I mean I can't do it. This is my life, this was my life before the bombs and it'll continue to be my life afterwards. I can't just leave, I mean we're trying to re-build society\u0085\"\n\"Fuck society! Why can't it just be me and you?\"\n\nMarina suddenly tells you a revelation you always had an inkling of, but never quite sure until today\u0085\n\n\"You know why I liked you in the beginning? Because all those years we worked in that office I saw a man who worked hard in a mundane job yet had the potential to be something more under the right circumstances. I'm sure you remember I said something similar five years ago when I convinced you to come with me. Then you proved me right somewhat by volunteering and taking charge of this place. I knew I'd chosen right. I was in love with you.\"\n\"Was eh?\"\n\"Yes, was. In the following years of you taking command of this place you've shown no more initiative. You've been content to just do the mundane routine of running this place. You were doing exactly the opposite of what I first saw. You were squandering your potential.\"\n\"So what was I supposed to be doing then Marina? Driving across the fuckin' wasteland shooting up people, taking their shit, and declaring their town part of the Combine like Harry?\"\n\"No, of course not. But you could've done something more. Like sending out your own exploration teams, or even going on them yourself. Maybe if you had, you wouldn't be in this position now. You'd have better leverage to face Harry. Maybe he is a fucking dictator, but he's accomplishing a goal.\"\n\nYou pack the last of your things and start walking while Marina follows you.\n\n\"Yeah, some goal\u0085Okay you know what Marina, fuck it. I gotta get outta here, and its apparent you've made your decision and I'm not gonna try to talk you out of it, because if you're that willing to throw fuckin' five years away just because I'm not the wasteland warrior that you dreamed up in your mind, then like I said fuck it. You're not worth my time either anymore. I hope you and Harry have a nice life, I'm sure he's exactly what you're looking for. Hope for your sake though his obsession for you is a lot stronger than his vindictiveness.\"\n\"Fuck you! It's not that goddamn black and white! I don't like fuckin Harry, and I never will, but\u0085HEY! Don't fuckin' walk out on me!\"\n\nYou storm out of the base, and Marina attempts to reason and explain, but it's all bullshit to you. This whole thing was. Trying to \"rebuild\" society, yeah right. As if there was anything worth rebuilding in the first place. You're done with this shit. You tried it and it was okay for awhile, but now its time to move on. Away from this and away from people.\n\nYou travel for a few days, and you expect Harry's men to come tracking you, but nobody ever follows you. You get attacked by a few mutated wolves, and a few mad men here and there, but nobody from the Combine. It's possible that you've done a good job of throwing them off, and Harry's people aren't skilled trackers, of course maybe Harry's just glad you're out of the way period. You briefly have an amusing thought, that Marina still had some sort of feelings for you and offered to be Harry's girl in exchange of letting you live.\n\nYou decide to think that's what happened, since you'll never know for certain and you've always been prone to imagine dramatic movie like endings.\n\n\"Heh. We'll always have Pandora.\" You laugh to yourself as you distance yourself further away from Combine territory.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Do something", "result": "\"Fuck off Harry, and take your Combine and shove it up your ass. We're seceding.\" You abruptly tell him over the radio, before announcing your intensions to everyone else in the base.\n\nYou get a mixed reaction of apprehension, while a lot of them aren't too fond of Harry, they still like living with basic necessities, something that becomes apparent in the weeks to come. There are a number of problems from the beginning.\n\nFirst of all, you're an isolated community and while that has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks, meaning the instant you tell Harry to fuck off and die over the radio, you're no longer getting any supplies of any kind, you're stuck with what you have. Medical supplies are scarce as it is; now they're non-existent. Forget about getting new ammo too.\n\nFood is a bit of a problem, (Water isn't, the base has its own water recycling and filtering system, fortunately it's on the surface rather than underground) since you were getting a majority of that from Fort Justice. Some hunting is done in the surrounding wilderness. It becomes a major problem though when Harry sends an invasion detachment and cuts you off from even doing that. It's not even like you can start farming even if you had the means since the inside of the base is completely paved (as well as harboring a deranged doctor and his cyborgs)\n\nThe only thing that prevents him from completely taking the place is the fact he's spread a bit thin in other areas of the Combine with keeping control of other towns and you're pretty well fortified. Doesn't mean he can't continue to harass you, and he can keep supplying his people. You can't. His people are somewhat more battle hardened as well. Not that you're saddled with a bunch of non-combatants, but anyone that's still following Harry willingly has been indoctrinated with a little more fanatic conformity, which is a great thing to have in a soldier. So great, you wish you had more people like that.\n\nA couple months after the initial siege; most people are ready to throw you to Harry's men in exchange for mercy. Marina and few others stand by you, but its mob rule. You're overwhelmed, disarmed and thrown to the invasion force outside.\n\nAll that still stayed loyal to you are immediately shot as traitors. The ones that turned on you are merely beaten (and a few of them shot to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again)\n\nYou and Marina are taken back to Harry. He gets a sadistic pleasure out of having you beaten in front of Marina. He attempts to give Marina one last chance to submit, but she refuses causing him to slap her upside the face and then start to rip off her clothes. You yell out, but are promptly beaten by Harry's guards again. Unfortunately for all his bravado Harry's unable to get it up. He tries like hell since he wants you to watch, but for whatever reason, his attempt at rape is a complete failure. Knowing the end is near anyway, Marina laughs at him before he smashes her skull against the ground yelling and screaming at her whole time.\n\nHe then kicks your bloody body and blames you for having to do that, you spit out a gob of blood and some teeth.\n\n\"Enjoy your fuckin' empire, you limp dick bitch.\" You groan.\n\"FUCK YOU, YOU GODDAMN PIECE OF SHIT!\" he replies back, grabbing his pistol off the table.\n\nHarry then ends your existence by emptying his gun into you.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}, null]}]}
